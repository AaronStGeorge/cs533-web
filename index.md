# CS 533 Homepage

Welcome to CS 533, *Introduction to Data Science*, for Fall 2021.

This web site is the central information point for the class, where I will be distributing the course materials, including lecture videos.

:::{warning}
This web site is still in draft mode, and no content (including syllabus and policies) should be taken as final until
this notice is removed.

I encourage you to browse the site, and to review [last year's
site](https://cs533.ekstrandom.net/F20/), but you are responsible for ensuring that you are working
from the final instructions when completing Fall 2021 coursework.
:::

Points of interest include:

*  The [syllabus](syllabus)
*  Canvas (for grades and submitting assignments)
*  Piazza (for Q&A and announcements)
*  [Week 0](content/week0/index.md) â€” start here!

I ask that you direct **all course questions** through Piazza, even if the question is just to me.
This will help me ensure that I do not miss any questions or concerns.
