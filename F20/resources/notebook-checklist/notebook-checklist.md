# Notebook Checklist

This checklist is to help you ensure your notebook is well-structured and well-written.
I may expand or revise it as we progress through the semester.

## Structure

-   Does the notebook re-run without error from top to bottom?
-   Does re-running the notebook produce correct charts and results?
-   Does the notebook begin with the document title as an L1 heading?
-   Are headings correctly nested (H2 within H1, H3 in H2, etc.)?
-   Are headings short titles? (No full sentences!)

## Writing and Output

-   Does the introduction state the notebook's purpose?
-   Does either the introduction or the data section describe where the data come from?
    -   If it's publicly downloadable, is there a link?
    -   If there are multiple options, which one is used?
-   Does it use correct grammar and spelling?
-   Does it use formatting to provide appropriate emphasis and clarity?
    -   Are Python variable, function, etc. names marked as `code`?
    -   Are lists used when helpful to break down points?
    -   Is mathematical notation used to precisely define measurements when it will increase clarity?
-   Do all outputs help advance the notebook's story?  Have you removed ones only for debugging or trying things out?
-   Do charts & conclusion-supporting outputs have surrounding text explaining their purpose and any extra information needed for accurate interpretation?

## Graphics

-   Do all charts have properly labeled axes and legends (color codes, etc.)?
-   Do charts have titles if purpose is not clear from axes or immediately preceding text?
    -   If there are multiple variants of a chart w/ same axes, they **must** have titles to quickly distinguish.
-   Are charts legible?
-   Do charts present lessons learned without distortions?
-   If you did not create the chart, would you be able to interpret it correctly?
-   Do facets, colors, and axes draw the reader to the most important comparisons or patterns?
-   Does surrounding text, if any, accurately interpret the chart?

The [Data Visualization Checklist](https://depictdatastudio.com/checklist/) is useful, if opinionated.

## Content

-   Are observations and conclusions substantiated by data and/or sound argument?
-   Are goals and observations made clear, both for the document and for individual pieces of analysis?
