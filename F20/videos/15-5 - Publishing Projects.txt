Publication Goals
Reader needs to understand:
What you did
What you learned
What they should do / take away

(In general. Not everything is actionable.)
Typical Outline
Introduction
Background & Related Work
Methods
Results
Discussion
Conclusion
Variants:
Some communities put related work at the end
Institutional reports often lead with Executive Summary
1-2 page summary w/ key points
Discussion may be merged w/ Results or Conclusion
Methods may split
Rendering Plots
High-quality images
When practical: vector images (PDF good for LaTeX)
Otherwise: high-resolution images (at least 300dpi, 600 better)
Complex images can overwhelm PDF
Clean and clear labels and captions
Distinct colors, shapes, etc.
Experiment with dimensions & aspect ratio
E.g. 5”-wide image, scale down to 3.75” columns
Step Outside Yourself
Forget you did the work and wrote the document.

Can you understand it? Could you reproduce it? Is info missing?

Applies everywhere:
Reports
Papers
README
Wrapping Up
