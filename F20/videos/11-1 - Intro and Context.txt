BUILDING AND EVALUATING MODELS
Learning Outcomes (Week)
Build and refine a predictive model

Apply regularization to control features and their interaction
Measure a model’s effectiveness and other behavior

Where We’re At
Linear regression (continuous prediction)
Logistic regression (binary classification)
Optimizing objective functions
Minimize loss functions (e.g. squared error)
Maximize utility functions (e.g. log likelihood)
Conditional Estimates
Distinction: Model Probability vs. Make Decision
Trick: Probability and Expectation
Wrapping Up
We are building models that estimate conditional probability or expectation and use them to make classifications.

We’re going to see more about their inputs and outputs this week.
