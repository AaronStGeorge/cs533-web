Fundamental Assumption
Deployment Assumption
Drifts and Shifts
Offline Solution: Temporal Splitting
Random train-test split ensures train/test comparable
Assumes test is uniformly drawn from same distribution!
Alternative: temporal split
Select temporally-contiguous test data (e.g. 1 month)
Train on data before test data (no time travel!)

Benefit: simulates actual use
Drawback: temporal data no longer random, inference harder
Online Solution: Continuous Monitoring
Instrument your system in production
Watch key metrics over time
Click-through rate
Classification rate
Regularly re-train and re-evaluate
Train model on new data
Evaluate model on new data
Wrapping Up
ML training and evaluation assumes that the training and test data match real life.

You canâ€™t always rely on that.
