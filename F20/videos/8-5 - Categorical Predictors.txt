Understand dummy coding

Categorical Variables
Unordered, discrete values (called levels)
Cannot do arithmetic
What’s gentoo * 3?
Even when integer-encoded, cannot use as model predictors!
Linear model coefficients measure change in outcome
Why should increasing user ID by 1 change outcome predictably?
One-Hot / Dummy Encoding
Convert levels to separate integer columns.

Encode with a 1 in the level’s variable, 0 elsewhere
N-1 Dummy Coding
Drop one level (typically first)

All 0 encodes the dropped level
Other levels encoded with a 1 in the proper place
Results
Categoricals are encoded as numeric variables
Can use in models (e.g. multiply by coefficients)
Wrapping Up
To use categorical variables in linear models, we need to encode them numerically.

Dummy-coding converts each level into a 0/1 variable indicating whether the observation has that value of the variable.
