Statistics
Inference
Inference is learning about data.

Estimating the value of a parameter
Testing the data’s support for an hypothesis

Estimates
An estimate is an estimated value of some underlying quantity
Often has a confidence interval or similar (e.g. credible interval)

An estimator is a procedure for computing an estimate.

An estimand is a thing we try to estimate.

Often use a statistic from a sample to estimate a parameter, which is the estimand.
Effect Size
The effect size is the size of the difference between two groups or treatments.
Perspective
Few bright-line rules – multiple pieces of evidence increase confidence
Probability is meaningful even without a random process – can quantify degrees of belief
Effect size and estimates are usually more important than hypothesis tests (but I’ll teach those anyway)
Wrapping Up
We’re going to move beyond computing and comparing statistics to reasoning about their impact and implications.

The foundations of this will be probability theory.
