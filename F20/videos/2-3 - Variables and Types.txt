Things
“Raw” Data
Data Set
Inferences
Answers
Phenomena / Experiment
Data Pipeline
Observations
An observation (sometimes called a sample)
Of the values of one or more variables
Pertaining to a single object/instance
Stored in Pandas as a DataFrame
Variables are columns
Data: Palmer Penguins
Penguin Variables
Species: penguin species (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap)
Island: island measured (3 options)
BillLength: length of bill (mm)
BillDepth: depth of bill (mm)
FlipLength: length of flipper (mm)
BodyMass: penguin body mass (g)
Sex: penguin sex (M or F)

Each about one penguin
Continuous Variables
Discrete Variables
A discrete variable takes on distinct values
Can have values with no intermediates
Might not even have order
Basically all other types of data!
Many types (next slides)

Stored as: lots of things
Integer
Integers are discrete
Counts, etc.
Order (4 < 5)
Example: number of penguins measured
Often treated continuously, to e.g. compute means
Average number of cats per cat-owning household (1.8)1
Stored as: int, sometimes float

Categorical
Variable that takes on one of a fixed set of unordered values
Can compare for equality
Cannot sort or do arithmetic
Can sort for convenience, but reflects convention, not meaning
Example: species (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap)
Example: user (userId in MovieLens)
Stored as: string (object), int, pandas Category
Boolean / Logical
Variable that is True or False
Special case of categorical
Usually stored as int or bool (which is a type of int)
Ordinal
Variable that takes on one of a fixed set of ordered values
Can sort, compare for inequality
Example: movie ratings (1–5 stars)
Example: class grades
Example: Likert scale (strongly agree – strongly disagree)
Really can’t do arithmetic
But we sometimes do anyway
Stored as: int, float, string (with externally-defined order), Pandas Category (in ordered mode)
Other Types
Time – usually continuous
Text – categorical-ish, usually converted to categorical or count
Images – matrix of ints or reals, will extract features
Money – often stored as int or float, but be very careful
Pandas Type Insufficient
Knowing the Python/NumPy/Pandas type is not sufficient

What is an ‘int64’?
Categorical? E.g. MovieLens userId, movieId
Continuous measured with integer precision?
Ordinal?
Logical 0/1?

Integers with missing values load as floats!
A Bit About Entities
What are the things being observed?
Databases: we call these entities
Sometimes straightforward: penguins
Sometimes complex and linked
Ratings
About movies
# of ratings could be a variable for a movie!
Wrapping Up
Many kinds of variables, broadly divided into continuous and discrete.

Conceptual variable types do not map 1:1 to Pandas types.

Need to be documented!
