What Is a Model?
A mathematical representation

Of the essential dynamics

Of a system of interest
Things
“Raw” Data
Data Set
Inferences
Answers
Phenomena / Experiment
Data Pipeline
Data Generating Process

Statistical Modeling
Simplify the DGP to predict an outcome
Correlational models look at relationships between observables
No causal claim unless experiment design enables it
Causal models model DGP more deeply to estimate causality
Subtle and quick to anger

Simplifications
Models necessarily simplify the problem

They hopefully capture enough to infer or predict usefully.

Unpredicted value is residual or error.

Parameters
Model parameters are numeric values as part of the model.

We estimate them from the data.
Mean critic rating for each genre (how to handle multiple membership?)

If the model captures the DGP, these are also underlying population parameters.
Example (adapted from Wikipedia)
Wrapping Up
Models simplify a process so we can understand or predict features of interest.

They are simplifications of the data generating process, to learn about it.
