Types of Operations
Convert data types
Standardize data codes
Remove or clean corrupt data
Fill missing data (with care)
Basic Data Type Conversion
.astype()
Converts data from one type to another
Parses strings w/ simple rules

df['column'].astype('i4')
Common NumPy data types:
Integer: i1, i2, i4, i8
Unsigned: u1, u2, u4, u8
Float: f4, f8

Also have bit-based sizes:
i4 = int32
f8 = float64 (double-precision)

Parsing Strings
pd.to_datetime — parse strings to date/time objects
Can specify format!
pd.to_timedelta — parse strings to difference between times)

Making Categoricals
Categorical variables save memory and can improve presentation.

String: series.astype('category')
Integer: pd.Categorical
After initialization: rename/reorder etc.
Standardizing Data
Normalize missing data
String encoding like ‘NA’?
Numeric sentinel values like -999?
Reassign to NA
Unify case (upper, lower, title, casefold) [series.str.upper]
Replace substrings [series.str.replace]
Trim whitespace [strip/rstrip/lstrip]
Rename codes [cat.rename_categories]
Merge codes [reassign, then cat.remove_unused_categories]
Cleaning Data
Strings are often corrupt – excess characters, etc.
Drop leading/trailing whitespace [strip and friends]
Match with regular expressions
Expression to match expected data & keep
Expression to match invalid data & delete
series.str.replace(regex, replace)
Extract specific columns [series.str.slice]
Clearing Data
Sometimes values are unrecoverably corrupt
Delete value (replace with NA or INVALID code)
May separate UNKNOWN from INVALID
Or just use one UNKNOWN code
Depends on question – I often separate early, combine later
Delete record (if unusable)
Don’t delete from underlying files – in memory, or in new files
Pandas Features to Study
Series methods
Top-level
Category methods under ‘.cat’
String methods under ‘.str’
Date-time methods under ‘.dt’
Wrapping Up
Data is messy.

Pandas gives us a number of tools for working with individual values or columns.
