Prediction and Inference
Prediction tries to predict the future with the model.

Model does not need to be valid
Quality & strength: accuracy of predicting unseen data
Evaluation does need to be valid
Inference uses the model’s structure and parameters to learn.

Validity depends on assumptions
Quality & strength: R2, p-value, assumption checks, coefficients
Inference
Assumptions:
Linearity — that this is actually a linear relationship
Independent observations
Normal residuals
Homoskedastic residuals (equal variance)
Prediction
Fitting assumptions: none

Testing assumptions: test data excluded from training
Train-Test
Data
Train
Test
Model
Split
Predict
Split before exploratory analysis of features.
Supervised learning – we have thing to predict
Splitting Data
Split before exploratory analysis
If testing multiple versions: split in 3
Train – train the model
Tune – optimize model, compare modeling decisions
Test – final validation, compare with current / previous system
Other Uses of Inference
Here: using analysis to understand (“infer”) things about the underlying world
Sometimes elsewhere: using a trained model to make predictions about specific instance (the “inference” stage of a machine learning pipeline)
Wrapping Up
Inference uses a model’s structure and parameters to understand an underlying phenomenon.

Prediction uses a model to predict future observations.

Inference has stronger requirements.
