Estimating
Goal: estimate the value of a parameter
True value in the world or population
Estimated by a statistic

Example: estimate approval of our company
Parameter: net approval (% of people who have a positive opinion)
Statistic: % of a sample of people who say they have a positive opinion
Goal: statistic is approximately parameter
A Few Sources of Bias
Selection bias
Some people more likely to be contacted

Response bias
Some people are more likely to respond

Measurement bias
Measurement skews one way or another



Population
Contacted
Responds
Opinion
Non-Uniform Bias
Bias may not affect all groups equally
Under-representation
Over-representation
Measurement skews
E.g. standardized test scores reflect socio-economic status
Documenting
Clearly and fully document data collection process!

See Datasheets for Datasets reading
Enables further and future analysis of collection process!
Helps future users assess if biases affect their problem

Wrapping Up
Goal is for data to accurately reflect population, and statistics to approximate parameters.

Various sources of bias can impede this.
