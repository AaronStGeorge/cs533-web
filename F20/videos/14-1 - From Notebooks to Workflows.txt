Managing Code and Data
Notebooks are great
Interactively test code
View results with code
Good visualization capabilities
Combine discussion, methods, and results

Limitations of Notebooks
Hard to reuse code from one notebook in another
Not great for long-running tasks
Limited running capabilities
Moving Beyond
Scripts are Python programs that run on their own.

Modules hold Python code to reuse elsewhere
Scripts
Notebooks
Other Modules
Pipelines
Transform / Prepare (ETL)
Raw Source Data
Prepared Data
Inference
Findings
Modeling
Model + Predictions
Data Description
Wrapping Up
Significant data science projects usually have multiple components in a pipeline.

Git is useful for tracking and versioning the code to generate these components.
