CS 533INTRO TO DATA SCIENCE
Michael Ekstrand
PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS
Learning Outcomes
Understand how data science outcomes can be used.
Think about how to put mdoels and outcomes into production.

Using Data Science
Data-driven reports to inform decisions
Regular forecasts for internal purposes
Data science outputs for real-time decisions
Internal
Customer-facing
Reproducibility
Reproduction is crucial:
Regular reports / predictions re-run
Daily / weekly / monthly reports
Retraining models for online use
Online Use
Many modalities: web, mobile app, desktop app, server infra
Mobile & desktop often use web tech to connect to models
HTTP (often REST) API
Some low-latency exceptions
Multiple audiences
Internal reporting
Internal decision-making
Customer decision-making
Service-Oriented Architecture
Client
Web Server
Services
Databases
Deployment
Predictions made available via a web service
E.g. TensorFlow Serving
Model trained offline on other hardware
Model-training script saves trained model to disk
Web service loads trained model & serves predictions
Useful Infrastructure Capabilities
Train models on live or freshly-exported data
Hold out test data to evaluate new model before deployment
Version your models (including retrain w/ same hyperparams!)
Roll back to old model version

Details depend on institution & infrastructure.
Skills to Learn
Web back-end programming (to build services)
Web front-end programming (to build dashboards)
Performance measurement & tuning
Wrapping Up
Many data science projects result in online production capabilities.

Often done by training a model and deploying it in a web service.
