Taking Our Bearings
We’ve seen:
Basic data operations
Visualization
Probability and inference
Correlations and linear models
Prediction and inference

Where we’re going:
Classification
Mostly prediction going forward
Evaluating model accuracy
More data types
Text
Time
Workflows

This Week
More on variance
Simulation methods
Prediction accuracy evaluation
Features
Wrapping Up
We’re going to learn more about building and assessing models.

This will set us up to move from regression to classification.
