Scatterplots
Remember them?

Scatter plots show relationships between two variables:
Each point is an observation
One variable on X axis
Other on Y axis

sns.scatterplot
plt.scatter
Including Distributions
Can include marginal distributions with scatter

Histograms on margins (jointplot)
“Rug plots” along axes

Useful for exploratory analysis.
Trend Lines - regplot
Pairwise Correlations - pairplot
Wrapping Up
We want to explore the relationships between variables.

Scatter plots and their variants let us do that, with possible augmentations.
