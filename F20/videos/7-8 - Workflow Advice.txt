Workflow
Single-Source Cleaning
Standardize representations
Delete corrupt data
De-duplicate if appropriate
Preserve information for downstream use
To evaluate impact of decisions
Keep goals and questions in mind
Integration
Link or pool records
De-duplicate (if appropriate)
Unify representations (if not done in per-source cleaning)
Describe integration results & resulting data set
Preserve information for downstream use
Analysis
Now you get to drop data, etc.

Select & reprocess the subset of data for a particular analysis
Different analyses may have different requirements
Multiple analyses and variants from the same data
Still may need to iterate w/ cleaning & integration
Wrapping Up
Data processing is an iterative, multi-stage process.

Preserving information for downstream use gives flexibility and helps us assess impact of upstream decisions.
