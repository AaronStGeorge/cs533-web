We’ve Seen
Computing within a group
Paired t-tests
Two-sample t-tests

Both relate a numeric outcome to a categorical predictor.
Paired Observations
Observe more than one variable for the same object

Relating Observations
Observations happen at different levels
A student graduated, or did not
The students at a school graduated at some rate
The students of a particular race at a school graduated at some rate
Predictions
Often, we group two (or more) variables into two:

Outcome variable describes a result
Dependent
Endogenous
Predictor variable(s) are used to explain or predict outcomes
Explanatory
Independent
Exogenous

Concept Qs more specific than quizzes – apply!
Wrapping Up
A lot of interesting problems will have two (or more) variables per observation.

We’re going to look at how to measure these variables’ relationships.

Often an outcome and 1 or more predictors.
