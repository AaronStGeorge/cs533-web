Simulation
We can make up data (with a random number generator)
We know the population parameters (we set them)
We can take unlimited samples (it’s just an RNG)

Result: we can study the behavior of sampling and statistical methods
Setting Up the RNG
Modern: np.random.Generator
Create with np.random.default_rng()
Can provide a seed (starting point) - integer
Recommended!
Same seed + software versions + platform ⇒ same results

Legacy: np.random functions
Python standard library also has random module
Drawing from Distributions
integers(k, size=n) — n integers in range [0,k)
integers(j, k, size=n) — n integers in range [j,k)
random(n) — n floats uniformly from [0,1)
normals(μ, σ, n) — n normally-distributed floats
exponential(λ, n) — n exponentially-distributed floats

Random and uniform are not the same thing.


More Randomness
Operating on arrays:
choice(a, n) — n draws from array a w/ replacement
permutation(a) — random reordering of a

More distributions: scipy.stats

Go NUTS: PyMC3, STAN
Example: Mean
Simulating Means (Law of Large Numbers)
Simulating Means — Check for Normality
Exponential
Simulation
We have a proof of the Central Limit Theorem

More complex methods are much harder to characterize.
Simulation lets us explore behavior

Also: useful for learning, gaining intuition
Not the Bootstrap
Bootstrap
Unknown population parameters
Resample actual observations
Estimate sampling distribution
Purpose: estimate population parameters
Simulation
Known population parameters
Sampling from theoretical distributions, making up data
Characterize sampling distributions & other properties
Purpose: understand estimate / parameter relationships
Wrapping Up
Simulation lets us study the behavior of statistical methods by drawing many samples with known population parameters.

This is commonly used in statistics research. You do it in A4.
