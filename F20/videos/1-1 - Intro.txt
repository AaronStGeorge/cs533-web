What is Data Science?
The use of data to provide quantitative insights on questions of scientific, business, or social interest.
Data and Meaning

“By itself, some piece of data has no meaning. Data is only given meaning – as evidence – by the people who make use of it.”

Sergio Sismondo, An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies, 2nd Edition. Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, page 133.
