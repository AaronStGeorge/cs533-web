Numbers
Python supports numbers like other programming languages

Integers: 1, 2, 47
Floating-point (decimal-ish): 3.5, 1.9, 2.4492
Can write in scientific notation: 6.02214e23
Can be negative: -3.14
Numeric Operations
Normal arithmetic operations behave how you expect:

+ - / *
Power: 2**5

Division is always floating-point: 5 / 2 is 2.5
Floor (integer) division: 5 // 2 is 2
