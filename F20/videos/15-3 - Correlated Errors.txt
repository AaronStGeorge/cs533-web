CORRELATED ERRORS
Learning Outcomes
Understand the idea of correlated errors and how they can be addressed.
Know when you need to look for a model that can handle correlated error.
Know two models to study further when needed.

Correlated Errors
Observations are not necessarily independent:
Time series: autocorrelated
Within-subjects designs: grouped
Other data may also be grouped
Medical data collected by hospital
Grouping Example
Example problem: measuring search engine effectiveness
Two search algorithms
Users issue queries
Results are assessed for relevance (experts or click logs)

Problem: results are not independent
* Some queries are harder than others
Naïve Solution
Stratified Errors / Group Effects
Fixed and Random Effects
Basic Idea: Modeling Additional Effects
Random effects capture natural sources of variance shared between observations
Performance: system effectiveness + query difficulty
Remaining variance (residuals) hopefully i.i.d. normal!
Our linear model works again

This applies generally – if we know an effect in the variance structure, we can remove it (“control for” it).
When To Use Stratified Errors
Any time your data points come in groups
Multiple measurements for the same object
Trying to understand difference between measurements
Understanding diff. between objects, they are fixed effects!

When you have an external feature shared between instances

Autocorrelation
Autoregression
Moving Average
ARIMA
Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average: ARIMA(p, q, r)
AR(p) model
MA(r) model
Applied to q-order diffs (1 = diff, 2 = diff of diffs)

AR & I can be viewed as a type of feature engineering
Integration with Prediction
Wrapping Up
We often have structured errors in a regression problem.

In some cases, modeling that structure yields a valid model.
