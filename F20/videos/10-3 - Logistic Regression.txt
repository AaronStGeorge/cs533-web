Linear Regression
Classification Setup
General Linear Models (GLMs)
Logistic Regression
Training a GLM
Generalized linear model
Binomial family (logit link)

p-values test significance

Predicting with GLM
scores = lg_res.predict(test)

Results in predicted scores (estimated probabilities)

Convert to binary class w/ threshold:

decisions = preds > 0.5
Terms
Outcome — the true outcome of the data we seek to predict
Called ground truth
Score — our prediction score (logistic: estimated probability)
Decision — our binary decision
Usually done by thresholding score
Some models & software directly output predictions
Wrapping Up
General linear models allow linear predictions of other quantities.

Logistic regression lets us use linear models for binary classification.
