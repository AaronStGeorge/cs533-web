    Thank you all for a great semester, and I hope you have a good break!

    This material will stay up indefinitely.  I may start moving links around when I teach it next, but this root page (<https://cs533.ekstrandom.net>) will take you to the material.

Points of interest include:

*  The [syllabus](syllabus)
*  Blackboard (for grades and submitting assignments)
*  [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kdyydav62no4a5) (for Q&A and announcements)
*  [Week 1](content/week1) — start here!
*  Zoom (links in Blackboard, under ‘Zoom Meetings’)

I ask that you direct **all course questions** through Piazza, even if the question is just to me.
This will help me ensure that I do not miss any questions or concerns.
