## General Rubric {: #rubric}

Unless otherwise specified, assignment components will be graded on the following rubric:

Exemplary (100%)
:   Results are correct and clearly presented; charts are well-labeled and appropriate; explanatory text clearly and concisely tells the story with appropriate context and analysis; organization makes it easy to review.

Basically Correct (95%)
:    The analysis comes to correct (or defensible) results and conclusions, but the presentation is not easy to follow and/or portions are not clear or lack context or labels.

Right Idea (80%)
:    The approach is appropriate, but the work has mistakes in code, analysis, or presentation that undermine the correctness of conclusions.

Solid Start (65%)
:    The work makes a good start, but has fundamental conceptual problems in code, analysis, or presentation such that it will not produce legitimate results.

Did Something (30%)
:    The solution began an attempt, but is either insufficiently complete to assess correctness or is on entirely the wrong track.

I may assign partial points between rubric anchors as a particular assignment merits.
For example, an assignment component that meets *Right Idea*, but where the flaws are relatively minor, may receive 85â€“90% of the component's points instead of only 80%.
