CS 533INTRO TO DATA SCIENCE
Michael Ekstrand
QUESTIONING QUESTIONS
Learning Outcomes
Identify stakeholders and subgroups for a problem
Evaluate the operationalization of a question to see who and what it prioritizes

Key concept: understand a metric by asking what makes it improve
Example from Last Video
Goal: Assess whether new change improved CS121

Question: Are students better prepared for next class?
Question: Are students more likely to pass CS 221?

Data: student grades for CS121 & 221

Caveats: many
Measuring the Question
Option 1: Pass Rate
What fraction of students pass CS221?
Does the new 121 method improve it?

Option 2: Grade
What is the average grade in CS221?
Does the new 121 method improve it?
Letter or course points?
Understanding Measurements
How do I improve this measurement?
Improving Metrics
Option 1: Pass Rate
Increase the number of people who pass the class
The only way to improve it is helping those w/ the most difficulty

Option 2: Grade
Make students do better
Can be improved at the top (A- â†’ A)
Measurement
You get what you measure.
Stakeholders
Students
Faculty
Department
Employers
University
High-performing students
Underprepared students
Marginalized students
How Do I Improve This?
Clarifies metric behavior

What changes to improve it?
What can remain the same while it is improved?
How can it be gamed or manipulated?

Metrics are always lossy and reductive, but this question helps evaluate and improve.
Wrapping Up
It is crucial to appropriately define measurements, and question our definitions.
