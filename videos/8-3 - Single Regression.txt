Estimate the parameters of this model
Identify the assumptions needed for the model‚Äôs inferential validity

Variables and Model
This is univariate (one-variable) regression
Regression Model
Regression Model
Note: I have extended this plot to have 0 at the left end of the x axis to highlight the intercept. Intercept is where the line crosses 0, not where it crosses the left Y axis.
DGP
Movie: *exists*
Critics: this is ok, I guess
Audience: üëè

Critic ratings do not cause audience ratings
Relationship does not need to imply causality
Fitting Lines
We can (almost) always fit a line
Resulting line is least squares
Can be used to predict

Inference makes assumptions:
Linear relationship
Independent observations
Normal residuals
Equal variance of residuals
Result: residuals are i.i.d. normal
Penguins
Explains 76% of variance
1mm flipper ‚áî 49.7g mass

Stats models warns us about condition number ‚Äì not actually a problem here. But we can still make it go away.

Wrapping Up
Linear regression predicts one variable with another using a linear relationship.

Inference makes several key assumptions.

Standardizing variables puts coefficients in units of standard deviations.
