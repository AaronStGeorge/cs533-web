00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,850
This video I'm going to talk with you about how to describe distribution,

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:17,950
so I said one of the learning outcomes with this week is that we can describe the distribution of a variable both numerically and graphically.

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:23,860
And we saw some of that in the descriptive statistics in the previous video.

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:30,100
We're going to go deeper into that in this video. So we want to be able to learning outcomes for for this particular video or to be able to provide

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,110
numerical descriptions of the distribution and visualize the distribution of a variable.

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:41,260
So the question when we ask, how is a variable distributed? There's a few questions that we want to.

7
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,880
A few things we want to break that down into four specific questions.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,570
First, what is the average value mean or medium, whichever is appropriate?

9
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,850
How spread out is the data? This these two things really give us a lot.

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,340
Where is the data? How spread out is it? Tell us a lot about it.

11
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,830
But then we want to look at is it skewed? Does it do values tend high?

12
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:08,140
Or do they tend low with respect to that that average value?

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,420
And then what does the data actually look like visually?

14
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,130
So the numeric descriptions, the previous videos, descriptive statistics give us quite a few.

15
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,180
The described method gives us a quick way to generate several of them.

16
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:31,420
So I generated a ten thousand random numbers. And they've got a mean and a median, both of about five.

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,990
They're spread out. Excuse me, a standard deviation about one.

18
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:43,600
So these numbers visualized or we can visualize them in what we call a histogram and a histogram shows how common different values are.

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,990
The x axis are the values themselves. And the Y axis is how frequent that value is.

20
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:57,760
It can be either account, the number of values, the number of observations that are about that value, or it can be relative.

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,590
The percent or fraction of observations. This is account one. We can see it goes up to twelve.

22
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:09,790
The Y axis goes up to twelve hundred. When we had a continuous variable, the number of Binz control the division points.

23
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:14,740
So I said Binz equals twenty five. That divides the variable into twenty five.

24
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:21,760
The range of the of the variable as we've observed it in the twenty five bins of equal width.

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,580
And so for each bean it's showing how many values fall into that bean.

26
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,800
So the largest bit is just over twelve hundred centered right at five.

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
This data is also symmetrical. There's no skew to it.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,400
There's a little bit of variation in the size stapes, the two sides, just the way things fall into the bins.

29
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:50,320
But there's no significant skew. It's evenly distributed around the mean, the mean and the median are equal reflecting that.

30
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,610
This this function, the highest function comes from the library matplotlib.

31
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,940
So the import for that is import matplotlib, that pie plot. The typical name for that is PLDT.

32
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:09,610
And that gives us functions to do. Plotting matplotlib is one of the fundamental plotting libraries for Python.

33
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:17,960
A lot of other plotting libraries such as Seabourne, Plot Nine, et cetera, are built on top of matplotlib.

34
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,240
So if we want to look at some real data, we can look at the average rating for movies.

35
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,470
So remember, we have this movie data set. We've computed each movies average rating.

36
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:36,180
Well, how are those average? How are those average ratings distributed? So, I mean, is three point seven the median is three point one five.

37
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,430
The there's a little bit of a what we call a left skew and the left skew this the direction and the skew is how far out.

38
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:51,200
The longer tail goes. So left skew means we have a longer tail on the left and the data is more bunched up on the right.

39
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,610
We have a longer tail on the left of the histogram. We can see that. That gives us a slight left skew.

40
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,500
The mean is slightly less than the median. That's also an indicator of left skew.

41
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,910
But it's not very skewed. The mean and the median are pretty close in this case.

42
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,350
We can also look at the movie rating count. So this is the distribution. So we have a variable.

43
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,360
So for each movie, we've got these two variables, its average rating and and the number of people who rated it.

44
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:21,530
And so we can look at the distribution of the movie rating count. This distribution is very, very heavily skewed.

45
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:30,080
A very strong right skew. The mean is much greater than the median for twenty three versus six.

46
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,880
Morreau, most this means most movies are going to have far fewer ratings in the mean and it's hard to

47
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,160
like the histogram shows us that it's skewed and shows us this huge spike at the small values.

48
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,030
But it's hard to really see what's happening with the distribution here.

49
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,350
So an alternate way that we can plot the distribution is.

50
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,380
So here's the word histogram. It just means the tabulation of how frequent each value is.

51
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,010
So we can compute the frequency of each value.

52
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,960
And the panda's method value counts. Does that. And so what we can what it computes.

53
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:13,110
It's a serious. Where the index is the values of the original series. And the value is the number of times that value appeared.

54
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:20,670
And so if we do that, we can then make a scatterplot and a scatterplot is where we plot some value on the X versus some value on the Y.

55
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:27,390
And the index, the index is an array. So our x axis and the scatterplot is the index, which is the actual values themselves.

56
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:35,820
And the Y index is the value of the earth in the array, which is how many times that value appeared in the original array.

57
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,860
And we're then we're going to do something. We're going to rescale it using what we call a log scale.

58
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,340
So you'll notice the Y, the X and the Y axes tend to the zero, tend to the one, tend to the to tend to the three.

59
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,370
Rather than being evenly spaced, they're evenly spaced.

60
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:56,640
The logarithms are evenly spaced and effectively since we're using ten base ten logarithms here.

61
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:05,520
What this does is it shows us, rather than the values themselves, that shows us the order of magnitude of each of the values.

62
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,890
And so. We can see one tend to the zero is the mode.

63
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:22,260
It's the most frequent one, that's the top point. And also we can see that the first part of the the first part of it is a lot, almost a line.

64
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,700
And when we have a line, we have a plot like this where the x axis is the number of ratings,

65
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,760
the y axis excuse me, the X axis is our value in the Y axis is how frequent that value is.

66
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,190
In this case, how many movies have that many ratings? And it's on a logarithmic.

67
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:49,510
It's on a log log scale. We when we see a line on a log log scale in this chart that indicates that what we're looking at is

68
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,510
a what's called a power law distribution or something that's close to a power law distribution.

69
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:03,100
And this is a common distribution that arises when we're talking about the popularity of various results of human activity.

70
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:10,000
It shows up in how frequently different words are used. It shows up in a lot of different human activity contexts.

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,200
If you look at, say, a social network. And you look at the popularity of different accounts.

72
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,990
You have accounts like Lady Gaga and beyond, say, have very, very popular Twitter accounts.

73
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,040
I have a moderately popular but much less popular Twitter account.

74
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,720
And a lot of people are down around 100 or 200 followers.

75
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,010
It's very common for the debt, for distributions of that kind of activity to fall to look like this.

76
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:43,650
And this kind of a chart where we have the scatterplot of X and Y axes is a good way

77
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,360
to see it and a good way to get a handle on what the state is actually looking like.

78
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,890
And we have this strong power law skew. So one of the artifacts of this I'm replanting our mean ratings here, except with more beans,

79
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,720
50 beans, instead of the default 10, we can we see the same basic shape.

80
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:08,450
We also see that a few values are much, much more common. Those values are one, two, three, four, five, two point five, three point five.

81
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,670
And the reason this is so these are exact rating values. Three point five is an exact.

82
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,620
You can rate it will be three point five. You can't rate a movie. Three point seven eight.

83
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:25,340
And so what the reason is. Look at how many movies have one rating.

84
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:31,820
Or two ratings. And if a movie only has one rating, it's mean rating is going to be the rating.

85
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:42,740
And so we're going to get a lot of movies since the most since this one rating is by far the most common popularity level of a movie.

86
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:50,090
We're gonna have a lot of movies. Where they're mean is exactly one of the possible rating values like three.

87
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,520
And so we see these spikes here in the distribution when we look at it in a more fine grained way,

88
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,020
just because there are so many movies that don't have very many ratings.

89
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:07,760
So we've seen numerical distributions, whether they're continuous, whether they're integer or other kinds of account data.

90
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,430
We've seen continuous distributions for a categorical distribution or go to as what's called a bar chart.

91
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,240
And so I'm again using value counts here to count the number of penguins.

92
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,460
So from the earlier video, the penguin dataset count the number of penguins of each species.

93
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:31,580
And then I'm plotting a bar chart that's showing us the the number of penguins that have each each species.

94
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,150
And we can see that the Adelie penguin is the most common here.

95
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:44,330
But the bar chart is going to be a really simple way to to view the distribution of a categorical variable.

96
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,440
Seabourne, which is an additional library we're going to see later, provides really convenient ways to do this.

97
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:57,740
But here I'm showing you the map, the raw matplotlib code, so that you can see how does the chart actually get generated?

98
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,020
It gets generated by counting, doing the value count, counting how many times each species appears.

99
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:16,559
And then we plot a bar chart whose x axis is the species and y axis is the number of times that species appears in the data set.
