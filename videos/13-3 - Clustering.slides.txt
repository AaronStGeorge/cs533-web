Grouping Things Together
What if we want to find groups in our data points?

We don’t know the groups (or we would classify)
Find them from the data

This is clustering
Membership Kinds
Mixed-membership: point can be in more than one cluster
Matrix factorization can be a kind of clustering

Single-membership: point is in precisely one cluster
Centroid-Based Clustering
K-Means Algorithm
Clustering in SKlearn
KMeans class
fit(X) learns cluster centers (can take y but will ignore)
predict(X) maps data points to cluster numbers
cluster_centers_ has cluster centers (in input space)

Other clustering algorithms have similar interface.
Evaluating Clusters
Look at them
Seriously. Look at them.
If you have labels, compare
Useful for understanding behavior
Quality scores
E.g. silhouette compares inter- and intra-cluster distances
Can be used to compare clusterings, no absolute quality values
Wrapping Up
Clustering allows us to identify groups of items from the data.

May or may not make sense.

Cluster quality depends on features, metric, cluster count, and more.
