WEEK 2: DESCRIBING DATA
Learning Outcomes
Hands-on practice loading data files in Python
Basic file descriptions
Identifying variable types
Text encodings
Questions
We’re a week in!

Questions or concerns?
HetRec Data
Documented in README.txt

From MovieLens (see demo)
Cross-referenced with IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes
Data Questions
Look at README.txt

What are 3 things you learn from it?
What are some open questions about the data?
What is one question you could try to answer with this data?
Observations and Variables
What are some of the observations? What kind of thing is being observed?
What are some variables? What kind are they?
Loading a File
These are TSV files  - tab-separated values

pd.read_csv('movies.dat', delimiter='\t', encoding='latin1')

Change delimiter to tab
Read in Latin-1 text encoding
Load the Data
One person share screen with Jupyter
Others follow along or co-pilot
Load some of the data files
Show data file size (len(frame), frame.shape, frame.info())
What columns do we have?
What types are the columns loaded as?
Does that match our expectation from variable discussion?
What open questions remain?

Questions
Let’s try one of these questions!
What operations do we need?
We probably haven’t discussed them yet!
