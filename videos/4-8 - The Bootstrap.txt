The Bootstrap
Bootstrapping a CI
Compute bootstrap means

boot_means = [np.mean(rng.choice(xs, n))              for i in range(10000)]np.quantile(boot_means, [0.025, 0.975])

Result: array([194.10294118, 197.52941176])
This is what Seaborn catplot does for error bars!
Bootstrap Distribution
Fun and Games with the Bootstrap
Estimate the sampling distribution for any statistic
Estimate arbitrary properties of the sampling distribution
Mean?
Median?
Quantiles?
Variance?

Wrapping Up
The sampling distribution requires taking multiple samples from the population.

The bootstrap allows us to approximate sampling distributions by resampling a sample.
