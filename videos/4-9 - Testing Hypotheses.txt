Flippers
Do Gentoo penguins have longer flippers than Chinstrap penguins?

What we can do:
Measure difference in average flipper length
Compute probability we would see that big a difference if they didn’t have longer flippers

This is called a “p-value”.
Hypotheses
Tests
Assumptions
Each test makes assumptions.

These are often quite strong!
T-test: data are i.i.d. normal
Pretty robust to violations

ANOVA
Data are i.i.d. normal
NOT so robust
Bootstrapping the p-value
Flippers
Multiple Comparisons
Pitfalls to p-values
