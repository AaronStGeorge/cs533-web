00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:16,070
Hi, no slides this time. Want to talk to you for just a few minutes about where to learn more, so we've introduced a number of Python things.

2
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,730
We're going to see more python things. We've introduced some basic inferential techniques.

3
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,110
We're going to see more inferential techniques. We're going to see more techniques of other kinds.

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:32,650
But this class, I'm not certainly not able to cover everything you're going to ever need to know.

5
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,530
You're not going to cover everything you're ever going to need to know and a master's degree or an APHC.

6
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,950
So where do you go to learn more? One immediate thing is to take more classes for many of you.

7
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,110
This is your first class in a data science oriented master's or HD program.

8
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,480
You're going to take, say, the machine learning class in the spring.

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,770
You're going to take maybe natural language processing, maybe recommender systems.

10
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,620
Maybe you're going to take one of the information retrieval classes or social network analysis.

11
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:07,840
The variety of classes you can go take classes in mathematics and statistics and econometrics and the econ department.

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,280
You can go look for econometrics. There's a variety of classes that you can take that can help fill in some knowledge.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,090
But beyond that, there's a lot you can do to study and learn more.

14
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,380
There's lots of books I'm referencing some in this class.

15
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:32,680
I'm going to be adding links to more as we go through the class further and get get to more techniques that are worth pointing you to a book for.

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,730
But also, some of the things that I do is, for one, I read a lot, particularly when I'm reading a lot of papers.

17
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,310
I read a lot of things on the Internet. And I pay attention to the statistical methods.

18
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:53,020
So I'm very active on Twitter, for example, and I follow a number of people who tweet about statistical methodology.

19
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,960
Some of them are very advanced and sophisticated statisticians, and I pay attention to what they have to say.

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:07,090
What are they saying about statistical methods? Oftentimes I need a lot more background to fully understand the argument that they're weighing in on.

21
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:14,340
But I'll see if it seems relevant to anything I'm working on and maybe go and get some of that background.

22
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,080
And so that's one sources is seeking out.

23
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:27,660
Blogs, social media feeds, etc, from people who are regularly posting information about statistical techniques or data science techniques.

24
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,540
You have to be careful. There's a lot of bad information out there. But there's a lot of quite good.

25
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:42,970
There's a lot of quite good and well-informed statisticians and data scientists who are posting things that you might want to pay attention to.

26
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:49,420
And some of them are also very, very funny. I also, as I'm reading research papers, I pay attention to their method.

27
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,520
Sometimes it's just to better understand the methods.

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,670
Sometimes a paper was going to have an interesting method that might be useful for me to add and adapt to my own research.

29
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,290
I also reflect on my processes as I'm working on a project.

30
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,360
They ask what's working, what's not? Where are the holes?

31
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,380
Whereas this project at the edge of my knowledge and I really need to understand something else to push it forward.

32
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,850
I pay attention when I'm at conferences to what methods do people seem to be applying?

33
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,030
What methods do I maybe need to add to my tool box?

34
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:26,500
Because people are getting a lot of value out of them and doing the kinds of research that I try to do.

35
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:34,870
I also spend time trying to understand my tools, reading the documentation for things like pandas and num pi, trying things out.

36
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:41,500
Oftentimes I'll spin up a notebook just to try something out, to see how it works and how it works in my data.

37
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,910
Looking at examples, I'm pretty opinionated in my programing, so there's a lot of examples I don't like,

38
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,700
but but looking at examples and trying to understand how other people did things and

39
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,680
why they did them that way and seeing what I can incorporate into my own process.

40
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,470
But a lot of it is practice. And also, I think as I'm working.

41
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,070
Is there a better way I can do this? Is there a way I can do this more efficiently?

42
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,450
Sometimes I don't care. Like, OK, that was fast enough. But paying attention to and reflecting on.

43
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,270
OK, how about how is this working? How am I actually doing?

44
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:19,570
This computation really goes a long ways towards identifying the places where I might need to go level up my skills.

45
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:27,970
So at the end of the day, what I do to keep learning more of this material is I pay attention to the work, both my work and the work of others.

46
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,550
Pay attention to the details. How are we getting these results?

47
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:40,780
What assumptions is this making? Are those assumptions valid? Can I apply this method in another technique, in another context?

48
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,980
It's question of all of that asking myself and then reflecting my own practice.

49
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,640
And as I'm working on a project. What am I happy about and how this project worked out?

50
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,500
What am I dissatisfied with?

51
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:58,570
What do I need to go learn in order to address the point of the project that this dissatisfied me and continually learn more things?

52
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:10,433
Spend time thinking, try the mountain new projects and building up my skills incrementally over time.
