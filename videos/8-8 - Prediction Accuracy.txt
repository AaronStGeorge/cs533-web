PREDICTION ACCURACY
Learning Outcomes
Compute the accuracy of a regression’s predictions
Understand the benefits of RMSE over MAE

Prediction and Inference
Prediction tries to predict the future with the model.
Inference uses the model’s structure and parameters to learn.

Predict
Split before exploratory analysis of features.
Supervised learning – we have thing to predict
Train-Test
Create test sample:
test = predictable.sample(frac=0.2)

Filter other data for training:
train_mask = pd.Series(True, index=predictable.index)
train_mask[test.index] = False
train = predictable[train_mask]
Evaluate
Fit model on train
Use fit’s predict method on testpreds = pfit.predict(test)
Compare predictions to test outcomes
Mean Absolute Error
Root Mean Squared Error
Translating a Formula
Why RMSE?
Interpreting Prediction Accuracy
MAE and RMSE are both in original outcome variable’s units
“Good enough” depends on application
What’s needed?
What’s the “noise floor” (minimum possible error)?
Can compare error of multiple models on equivalent test data
Wrapping Up
We measure a predictor’s accuracy by comparing predictions to test data that wasn’t seen in the training process.
