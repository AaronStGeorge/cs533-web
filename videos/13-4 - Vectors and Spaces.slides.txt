Vector Spaces
Vector Operations
Addition (and subtraction)
Scalar multiplication
Inner products (sum of elementwise products)
Distance (inner product of subtraction with itself)
Matrix of Data Points
What Is A Matrix?
A collection of row vectors
A collection of column vectors
A linear map from one vector space to another

A few matrix ops:
Addition
Multiplication (by scalar or compatible matrix or vector)
Transpose
Special Matrices
Matrix-Vector Multiplication
Transformations
All by multiplying by a matrix:
Reduce (or increase) dimensionality
Translate
Scale
Skew
Rotate
Any linear transformation (this is actually what linear means)
Linear Systems
Wrapping Up
Vectors represent data points in a vector space.

These can be manipulated and transformed.

Linear algebra teaches much more.
