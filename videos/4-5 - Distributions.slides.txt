Numeric Distributions
We’re going to focus on distributions of numeric variables
Both discrete and continuous
Categorical: encoded to 0, 1, etc.

Bernoulli Distribution
Characterizing Distributions
Parameters:
location, scale, shape
Characterizing Distributions
Parameters:
location, scale, shape

Density or mass function

Support (range it’s defined over)

Underlying random process
Key Statistics
Mean (first moment)
Standard deviation or variance
Variance is second central moment
Median (50th %ile)
Binomial
Binomial(10, 0.3)
Normal (Gaussian)
Wrapping Up
Random variables are often described by probability distributions, which may have parameters.

There are many standard probability distributions.
