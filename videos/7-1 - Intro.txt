Questions
How do we link it to other data?
Should we link it to other data?
How effective is the linkage?
What cleanup is needed to make it useful?
What ethical concerns govern its collection or use?
What biases might it contain?
We will never be exhaustive
Data is biased â€“ question is how, and with what effect?


Things to Do
Get the raw data files
Transform data into usable format
Convert data types
Unify appropriate special codes (e.g. missing data)
Extract identifiers
Link with additional data sources
Extract the data set needed for your task
General Principles
Avoid Discarding Data
Measure Every Step
Look At Your Data
The Anna Karenina Principle of Data Science
Clean data sources are all alike; each messy data source is messy in its own way.
Wrapping Up
Data comes from a variety of sources.

We often need to compile multiple data sources to answer a question.

We need to question and document our data.
