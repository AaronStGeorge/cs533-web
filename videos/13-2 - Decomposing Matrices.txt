What Is a Matrix?
Matrix Multiplication
Sparse Matrix
A matrix is sparse (mathematically) if most values are 0.

Sparse matrix representations only store nonzero values
scipy.sparse

np.ndarray is our dense matrix
DataFrame and Series cannot be sparse ðŸ˜” (they store 0s)
Dimensionality Reduction
Why?
Compact representation
Remove noise from original matrix
Plot high-dimensional data to show relationships
SVD preserves distance
SVD can improve distance
Find relationships between features
Principle Component Analysis â€“ find vectors of highest variance
How?
Principal Component Analysis
Use Case 1: Compression & Denoising
Use Case 2: Visualization
Low-dimensional vectors can be visualized!
See example notebooks

Use Case 3: Better Neighborhoods
High-dimensional spaces have 2 problems for distance:
Distance more expensive to compute
Points approach equidistant in high-dimensional space

Decomposed matrices can improve this!
k-NN classification
k-means clustering
Use Case 4: Categorical Interactions
Wrapping Up
Matrix decomposition (also called matrix factorization or dimensionality reduction) breaks a high-dimensional matrix into a low-dimensional one.

It preserves distance and, in some configurations, finds the direction of maximum variance.
