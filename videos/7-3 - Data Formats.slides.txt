Types of Data
Tabular is organized into columns and rows like a spreadsheet.
Each row has the same shape & attributes.
Semi-Structured data has structure, like labeled fields, but different objects can have different fields.
Unstructured data has no defined structure. Includes raw text and images.
Tabular Data
Delimited text
Comma-separated (CSV)
Tab-separated (TSV)
Spreadsheet files
Excel (xlsx or xls)
Sometimes actually TSV ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

‚Äú.dat‚Äù means nothing
Binary formats
HDF
NetCDF
Parquet
Other
Matlab
STATA
‚Ä¶

Delimited Text
One record per line (usually)
Delimiter: comma, tab (\t), |, ‚Ä¶
Escape:
Quotes: "field"
Double-up quotes to escape inside
Backslashes
Header: usually first row
Pandas read_csv / to_csv pretty portable (though watch index!)
Semi-Structured Data
JSON: dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, true/false, null

XML: trees of nodes with text and attributes

YAML: JSON ++
MSGPACK
RDF, SQL
Others‚Ä¶
{ "fit": "fit", "user_id": "420272", "bust size": "34d", "item_id": "2260466", "weight": "137lbs", "rating": "10", "rented for": "vacation", "review_text": "An adorable romper! Belt and zipper were a little hard to navigate in a full day of wear/bathroom use, but that's to be expected. Wish it had pockets, but other than that-- absolutely perfect! I got a million compliments.", "body type": "hourglass", "review_summary": "So many compliments!", "category": "romper", "height": "5' 8\"", "size": 14, "age": "28", "review_date": "April 20, 2016"}
Unstructured Data
Raw text ‚Äî (usually) human-written text 

Images ‚Äî we can try to get data from images

Can appear as a field in tabular or semi-structured data.
More Data
A table‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ in a PDF
‚Ä¶ in an image in a PDF
‚Ä¶ in a photograph in a PDF

Corrupt data
Syntactically invalid XML
Incorrect JSON syntax
Weird nonprinting characters
Encodings
Text data is encoded (more on this later)
UTF-8: modern standard
Many older encodings, both single-byte and double-byte
XML declares encoding
JSON almost always UTF-8
Text (delimited or unstructured): ???

Encodings are not self-describing.
Look at Data
Mac/Linux: less
Windows: Notepad++ (or other text editor)

Data may be compressed, usually indicated in extension
.gz
.xz
.7z
.zip	
Unix: zless, etc.
Wrapping Up
Data comes in many formats.

Sometimes it is tabular, semi-structured, or unstructured.

Some formats are nice. Others are not.
