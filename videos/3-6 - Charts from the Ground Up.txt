Design a chart by thinking first of the questions, goals, and data

What is the Question?
What question do we want to answer?

How, precisely, did we operationalize it?

What data are we using?
Specifically, variables
Example: Titanic Survival
Question: were passengers in higher classes more likely to survive?

Outcome variable: survival
Logical variable, 0/1 encoded
Taking mean yields numeric response!
Mean is probability of survival (1)
Also called response variable or dependent variable

Explanatory variable: passage class
Categorical
Also called independent variable
Bar chart
Showing Relationships
Most plots show how a numeric variable changes between different values of one or more other variables.

What is the variable to show?
What do we want to show about it?
Statistic?
Distribution?
How do we want to compare between EV values?
Even histograms follow this!
Response: frequency (count, proportion, density)
Explanatory: value or bin
Pipeline
Identifying these informs:

Data processing (e.g. binning, group-aggregate, transform)
Choice of plot type
Axes, labels, colors, facets
Variable Types
Response is numeric (or transformed to be)
Categorical → relative frequency

Explanatory can be anything
Numeric → continuous axis
Categorical → discrete axis
Ordinal → discrete axis preserving order; may omit some labels
One Explanatory Variable
If EV is continuous: scatter or line
Scatter plots we sometimes blur response/explanatory

If EV is discrete:
Bar chart shows statistic, emphasizing relative difference
Point plot shows statistic, emphasizing absolute difference
Box or violin plot shows distribution
Two Explanatory Variables
Pseudo-3D:
Contour plot: identify peak(s) & shape
Heat map: see where high & low points are
Demonstration
Two Explanatory Variables
Pseudo-3D:
Contour plot: identify peak & shape
Heat map: see where high & low points are

Other aesthetics for secondary variables:
color, shape, size
Occasionally used to indicate second response variable

Titanic by Class and Sex
More than Two EVs
Can’t really have more than 1, maybe 2 numeric
Others can be binned

Facets let us break down the plot by more categorical explanatory variables.
Facet Plot
More than Two EVs
Can’t really have more than 1, maybe 2 numeric
Others can be binned

Facets let us break down the plot by more categorical explanatory variables.

Pay attention to order. It strongly affects what readers compare.
Stacking
Stacking lets us see differences in composition – how do the parts of a whole change?

Stacked bar charts
Stacked area charts

Can be either raw values or fractions.


Transformations
Sometimes we transform the axis
Log-10 scale – shows order of magnitude
Generally don’t do this to bars

Sometimes we transform the data
Rescale, log, square root
Normalize by a value
Be Careful
Avoid excessive complexity
Be careful with color (easy to make indistuingishable)

A good graphic reveals the data, and does not distort or obscure

Wrapping Up
Identify variables and relationships you want to highlight.

Design a plot that illustrates them.

Study plotting library APIs.
