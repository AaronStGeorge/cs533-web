CONTROL STRUCTURES
Learning Outcomes
Write basic Python control structures
Understand Python block syntax
Know standard practice for whitespace

Key concept: Python uses whitespace to detect blocks, such as the bodies of loops or conditionals.

For Loops
for i in range(5):    print(f'iteration {i}')print('done')

Iterate over an iterable
range(5) iterates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Whitespace delimits blocks
Blocks
Python blocks begin with ‘:’ at the end of a line
if, else, elif, for, while, def, class

Block content is indented one level
Standard practice is 4 spaces (Jupyter defaults to this)

Block ends when indentation returns to previous level
for i in range(5):    print(f'iteration {i}’)print('done')
Comments
Python comments
Begin with ‘#’
Continue until end of line

# this is a comment
print('foo')  # can comment here too
If Statements
x = 5if x >= 10:    print('big')elif x >= 5:    print('medium')else:    print('small')
These are false:
False (Boolean value)
None (equiv. to null)
0
Empty list, set, or tuple ([])
Empty string('')

Most other things are true.
While Loops
while condition:    # do something    pass
Iterates until condition is false
‘pass’ does nothing
Here only to make it valid Python
Wrapping Up
Python provides the usual control structures (if, for, while)

Blocks are based on indentation

'#' starts a comment
