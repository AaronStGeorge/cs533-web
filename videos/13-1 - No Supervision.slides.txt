Cluster data points.

Learning So Far
We learn to predict a label
Categorical label → classification
Continuous label → regression

This is called supervised learning
We have ground truth for outcome
Sometimes called supervision signal
Unsupervised Learning
What can we do without a supervision signal?
Group instances together (clustering)
Learn vector spaces for items
Learn relationships between items
Learn relationships between features
Middle Ground: Self-Supervised Learning
Sometimes we can extract supervision signals from data
Word embeddings: predict if two words appear together

Why?
Exploring data
Reducing data complexity
For visualization
For learning (“curse of dimensionality”)
Inputs into other models
Sometimes it’s all we have
Wrapping Up
Unsupervised learning learns patterns from data without labels.

It’s useful for grouping items together, exploration, and as input to other models.
