Understand the function of a regularization term in a loss function
Apply regularization to logistic regression models
Tune regularization parameters

Loss and Regularization
Vector Norms
Understanding Regularization
How do you increase loss?
Increase a coefficient
How does that happen?
Strong relationship
More of the common factor on one than another
Balancing
Regularization Factor
Lasso Regression
The Elastic Net
Applying Regularization
Standardize numeric first
Coefficient strengths are comparable
0 is neutral, coefficient magnitude is strength of relationship
Select hyperparameters based on performance on tuning data
Scikit-Learn CV classes help with this
See notebook for example
Wrapping Up
Regularization penalizes large values of coefficients.

This controls model structure and, combined with standardization, requires “strong” beliefs in relationships to be justified by reducing training error.
