1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,890
This video, I want to talk some about data sources where our data is coming from and particularly

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:15,230
introduce the concept of bias and start to talk about where biases can come from in our data.

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:23,030
So our learning outcomes are to understand what bias means and start to identify the sources of bias and observations of a variable.

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:31,120
So one of the goals of a lot of our data science work is festively as we develop more sophisticated tools is going to be to estimate things.

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,260
And in statistical terminology, what we say is that we're estimating the value of a parameter.

6
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,190
So I introduced the term statistic in the previous in a previous video.

7
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,430
But a parameter is some property of.

8
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:53,570
Of the world or of the population that we're trying to study. And our goal is to estimate that with some statistic.

9
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,040
So if we have our data pipeline, we have the things that we're trying to study,

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:08,920
we can we have observable phenomenon or experimental results that come out of those that become raw and then processed data.

11
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,350
The goal is to be able to use the data,

12
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:20,230
the processed data to estimate to computers a statistic that allows us to estimate the value, the parameter back in the world.

13
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:27,160
For example, if we want to understand the approval of our company.

14
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,920
And we want to estimate the parameter of either the net approval, like the number of people who agree,

15
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,490
minus the number of feet who approve of our company, minus disapprove.

16
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:44,670
Or maybe the percentage of the citizens of residents of the society who have a positive opinion of our company.

17
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,790
We could computer statistic.

18
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:52,750
We could take a sample of of people and look at the percentage that of that population that has about half of that sample,

19
00:01:52,750 --> 00:02:00,610
that has a positive opinion of our company. And the goal of this process is that the statistic is approximately the parameter.

20
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:09,190
And what bias is bias is when the statistics systematically differs from the parameter.

21
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:18,950
And there are a few sources of this. One is selection bias, where some people are more likely to be contacted than others in our survey.

22
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,680
And it and if the people are poor,

23
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:29,180
more likely to be contacted are either more or less likely to have a positive opinion than those who aren't contacted.

24
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,700
That's a source of bias. Response bias is some people are more likely to respond.

25
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,290
So if one survey method is called random digit dialing, where you dial random phone numbers,

26
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,510
if some people are more likely to pick up the phone than others,

27
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,290
or if some people are more likely once they find out what the call is to respond to the survey than others.

28
00:02:52,290 --> 00:03:03,300
That is that's going to also induce a bias. And then measurement bias is when the way that we measure the results skews one way or another.

29
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,360
And in our example here where this could arise is if the way that we frame the question.

30
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,620
Bias is the approval positive? What people say positively or negatively or how they respond?

31
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:26,210
Then that we have the response, they're going to answer our questions. But we've changed how there's a bias in how their opinion translates into data.

32
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:36,450
These biases can come up at the biases that these stages of the pipeline can come up and almost any data collection kind of process.

33
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:48,360
Controlling for them and counteracting them is a significant field of study where reputable, reputable political pollsters,

34
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:57,480
reputable survey organizations have very good mechanisms for quantifying and reducing these sources of bias.

35
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,820
But it's a way when we have our from the population of people, we're trying to study objects.

36
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:11,440
We're trying to study through to the data that we actually get. It's the places where we're bias can come into the process.

37
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,500
Bias also may not affect all groups equally.

38
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,410
We may have a group that shows up more frequently in the data than than they are in the population less frequently.

39
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:28,060
There may be a measurement skew so that the the way that we're measuring our data

40
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,530
responds to the thing we're trying to measure differently between different groups.

41
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:43,000
So one is one example of this is standardized tests like the S.A.T. and the ACTC are intended to measure your academic preparedness for college.

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,680
But there's two things that go into how well you're going to do in the essay tier.

43
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,720
The ACTC one is your raw economic or academic preparedness.

44
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,450
How good are you were engaging with the kind of material that they're testing your ability to engage on,

45
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:07,420
and the other is your preparedness for the test itself. And there are a lot of test preparation resources that help you prepare for the test.

46
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,670
Then there's the other things of just how much time do you have available to study and things like that.

47
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:24,850
And one of the outcomes of that is that socio economic status becomes a very strong indicator in a very strong factor in standardized test scores.

48
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:32,920
So if you have two students who given the same situation and the same economics, the same economic situation,

49
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,520
the same level of stress, the same level of preparedness would be able to equally well engage with the material.

50
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:47,930
And that ideally is what you want to test if you're say seeing if someone is going to be a an effective college student.

51
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,440
The one who has more economic security, they don't have to work as many hours that take from their studies.

52
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,160
They have the ability to, four, afford more test prep resources.

53
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,540
They're going to score higher on the standardized test than the person who, because of their social situation,

54
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:11,420
because of their economic situation, because of their background, is goes into the test less prepared.

55
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,230
These students, given this, if you swapped their circumstances, the scores would swap.

56
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:22,070
There's no difference in the student's academic ability to engage with the material and to do the work.

57
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:32,240
The system is responding. The measurement instrument, the standardized test is responding differently to the thing it wants to measure based on the

58
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,490
socio economic status and surrounding circumstances of the student we're trying to measure.

59
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,990
So one of the things immediately that we need to do with this in line with our theme this week

60
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,600
of describing data is that we need to clearly and fully document the data collection process.

61
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,220
This is a major focus of the data sheets reading because and this this does a few things at first.

62
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,150
It forces us to think about it if we're creating the data or if we're using an existing dataset.

63
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,250
We're trying to find the answers to these questions. It then enables further and future reuses of the data,

64
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:12,560
because if we've carefully documented the collection process, the data processing, etc., that results in the data.

65
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:21,380
Then other people who come across the data, future users that may want to reproduce our analysis, may want to apply the data to a different problem.

66
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:30,920
They'll have the information they need to assess what the likely biases are and if those biases are likely to be to affect their problem.

67
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,400
It also creates the basis for as potential if we discover in the future through research, additional potential biases.

68
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,140
It lets us go back and see well, based on the documentation of how this data is collected,

69
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,210
how likely is it for that to be a problem for this data as well? So the takeaway I want you to have, right.

70
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:53,680
I want you to start thinking about how bias can affect our data. And is this a bias?

71
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:03,160
Is is the systematic from a statistical perspective? Bias is the systematic deviation of our estimate from the thing we're trying to estimate.

72
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,370
But document your data. Look for the documentation of the data that you're using.

73
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,380
So to wrap up the goal,

74
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:19,480
as for our data to accurately reflect the population and for the statistics we compute from it to accurately and reliably approximate parameters,

75
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,030
they're never going to exactly equal the quantity of interest.

76
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:29,170
But hopefully they're pretty close and hopefully there's not systemic or systematic differences in one way or another.

77
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:45,676
But various sources of bias, sampling, bias, response, bias and measurement bias just for three.
