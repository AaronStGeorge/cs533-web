Time Series
Time Series
Time Representation
Many representations:
String dates
Years & months
Timestamps (seconds, ms, etc.)

Pandas: must convert to a datetime
pd.to_datetime
Pandas Setup Steps
Create/convert datetime column with instance times
Index data frame by timestamp
Sort index

ratings['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(ratings['timestamp'], unit='s')rts = ratings.set_index('timestamp').sort_index()

Time series exception to “prefer unique indexes” guideline
Operation: Resampling
Like groupby, but on time intervals
Compute aggregate functions for time intervals
‘on’ option allows a non-index column

monthly_ratings = rts.resample('1M')['rating'].count()
Operation: Plotting
Matplotlib & Seaborn render timestamp X axes well

sns.lineplot(data=monthly_ratings)
Operation: Range Select
Time series indexes support range operations
Select by range: rts.loc['2010-01-01':'2010-12-31']
Includes end point (unlike normal slice!)
Select by period: rts.loc['2010-07']
Operation: Diff and Shift
Time Effects
Autocorrelation
Wrapping Up
Repeated data over time requires particular handling and has distinct operations.

Pandas provides these through datetime columns and indexes.
