So Far
Tabular data – equivalent set of features for each instance

Other types:
Semi-structured – has defined fields, can vary
Unstructured – no defined fields
May have associated semi-structured metadata
Features from Data
“Raw” features
Words
Pixels

Tabular features
Size / length
Sentiment, etc. (mined with other models)
This Week
We’re going to:
Process unstructured text
Use words (or similar tokens) as features
Use it to classify (and eventually cluster)
Wrapping Up
Unstructured data doesn’t come with nice data-frame features.

We can use direct content as a large feature space, or derive a smaller set of features from the data.
