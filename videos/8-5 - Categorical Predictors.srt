This video, I want to talk about how to use categorical variables as predictors in our linear models,

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:18,320
learning outcomes are for you to be able to use a categorical predictor and understand what dummy coding is and why we use it.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,500
Categorical variables, if you'll recall from earlier in the class or unordered discrete,

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,650
the variables that take on an unordered set of discrete values that are called levels.

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,560
And one of the things about these is we can't do arithmetic. You can't say like Gentoo Penguin Times three.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,110
That's not a meaningful concept to talk about.

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:44,510
And even when we're using integers to encode our categorical variables, for example, a movie idee or just any kind of an I.D.,

8
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,490
we can't use those as model predictors because then they don't have numeric meaning.

9
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,180
It doesn't mean anything to multiply a movie idea by a coefficient.

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,150
And so we need another way to encode categorical variables if we're going to use them in our linear models.

11
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:07,350
And the solution is something called dummy coding. So what we do is we convert each level into a diff separate integer column.

12
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,460
So our penguin's dataset has three different penguin species, Adelie chinstrap and Gentoo.

13
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,850
And each of those becomes a column.

14
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:26,460
The pandas get dummy's function will get will convert Assiri a categorical series into a data frame of Dumi coded values.

15
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,910
And so this will give us the. So give us the dummy codings for the penguins.

16
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:39,360
And we have a we have one for each for each species.

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,400
This is also called one coding. Particularly when we're doing this, we have one for every level.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,790
It's call we. It's one hot coding or dumi coding.

19
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:54,180
Another way that we can have a one where we have a one in the Adelie caller.

20
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,910
If that penguin is in a deli and we're gonna have a zero everywhere else because we only have one value of the categorical variable perone.

21
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:08,420
Often, though, we need to drop one of the categorical or one of the variables.

22
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,580
Typically the first one and we do this with the drop first option to get dummies.

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,860
And the Adelie column now, you'll see, is gone. We just have chinstrap and Gentoo.

24
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,820
And what how it's encoded is at a deli.

25
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:31,640
Penguin is all zeroes, but it chinstrap Penguin will have a one in the chinstrap column in a agentive will have a one in the Gentoo column.

26
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,710
This is going to be particularly useful for linear regression because if we have all of the levels,

27
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:42,100
we're going to have problems of fitting our linear regression models. If we just have we have all but one of them,

28
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,930
then effectively we're treating one of the levels as the default and the other levels are getting the code for what

29
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:57,880
happens when your when it's one of the other values instead of the first or the default value that you chose.

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:05,110
So the results of this are that the category of calls are encoded as numeric variables that we can then use in models.

31
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,520
We can multiply that, my coefficients, et cetera. We're going to see that in a model coming up.

32
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,380
Wrap up to use categorically in our linear models or other Neumar models, or we're going to need to do numeric computations on a categorical value.

33
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,970
We need to encode them numerically dummy coding.

34
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:29,780
Let's do this by converting each level into a zero one variable that indicates whether or not the observation has that value of the variable.

35
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:41,067
And often we drop one so that four end levels we have N minus one dummy variables and all zero is the.
