00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,900
Hello and welcome to see us five thirty three, introduction to data science.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,650
This is the introduction video that's going to give you an overview of what it is going to we're going

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,960
to be talking about this semester and provide you with guidance for how to get started with the course.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,650
Are learning outcomes for this video are to introduce the class subject.

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,290
What is data science for our purposes?

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:30,650
For you to understand the learning outcomes of the course, for you to understand how this class is structured at a high level,

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:39,890
we'll be supplementing this with discussion in class and then also to know where to get help throughout the semester as you're in the course.

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,030
To get started, though, I want to talk about what data science is.

9
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,460
And there are many different people are going to have many different definitions of data science.

10
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:59,730
But one of the things that. But the definition I've been using as I've built out this class is that data science is the use

11
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,150
of data to provide quantitative insights on questions of scientific business or social interest.

12
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,420
There may be many different things to which we want to apply the science we may have maybe in a business context,

13
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,570
but we want to gain understanding about the effectiveness of our business processes.

14
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:26,040
We may want to evaluate a change to some aspect of how we carry out our business or how we manufacture, provide our products.

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,990
We may want to understand the impacts of some of our business decisions.

16
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:38,310
We may have a scientific question. What we are trying to produce generalizable knowledge to understand the world around us.

17
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,170
We may have a social interest,

18
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,670
particularly if we're deploying data science in the context of a nonprofit or of a government agency or of an educational institution.

19
00:01:47,670 --> 00:02:00,640
What we're trying to understand, social dynamics of human behavior. We're trying to understand maybe the impact of a policy on on.

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:13,880
For example. We may have social interest where particularly if we are deploying.

21
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,640
We may have social interest, particularly if we are deploying data science in a nonprofit or a government agency

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,720
or an educational setting where we're trying to understand social dynamics,

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,700
we're trying to understand the effectiveness and the impact of policies and programs

24
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,110
and various other purposes to inform our social mission with quantitative insights.

25
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:43,780
To give you some more about how I go about thinking about this and some more of the background of how I've been designing the class,

26
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:51,310
I find this quote from Sergios Mondo's Introduction to science and Technology Studies useful in a book.

27
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,990
He says, By itself, some piece of data has no meaning.

28
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,330
Data is only given meaning as evidence by the people who make use of it.

29
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,990
And this means that we can't just go find a bunch of data.

30
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:15,610
And, oh, we have the answer. We have to do work to get our data into a form where it can actually provide answers to the questions we care about.

31
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:23,610
We need to do work to frame our questions in a way that we can actually.

32
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:31,770
Answer them with the data that we have available or that we can obtain, and this is a human process and it's also a social process,

33
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:37,200
which is one of the reasons why we're going to be using our own class time for

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,820
discussion and application exercises is because we need the data of the data,

35
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,310
gains its meaning and becomes evidence for particular conclusions of particular answers.

36
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,370
Because we go through the process of interpretation and we go through the process of presenting our

37
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,250
interpretations for other to others and discussing and debating how we came to the conclusions,

38
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,030
the conclusions. We came to the level of support they have from the data.

39
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:15,900
So we're going to be practicing that a lot in this class of going from data to evidentiary meaning as a human process and pursuit of all of this.

40
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:24,180
There are a number of learning outcomes for this course. The first one is that I want you to be able to explore a data set.

41
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,550
Someone gives you some data and you first need to be able to get your bearings and understand what data you have,

42
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,520
be able to assess whether or not it would answer particular questions and what questions you might be able to answer with it.

43
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,960
You need to be able to define a question that we can answer.

44
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:48,200
So this is a. This is not an easy process when you're talking about quite a bit more about it in the next two videos.

45
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,720
But taking a goal that we have and turning it into a question that we can actually answer

46
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,990
through a data analysis is a process that takes work and we're going to be learning that.

47
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:09,350
I want you to be able to then actually carry out your analysis in a way that is documented so other people can understand what you did,

48
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:18,710
it's reproducible, so others can do the same analysis. And it also doesn't unnecessarily waste computing resources to come to the answers.

49
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:27,730
You make efficient use of the resources we have available to us. And also then we can scale to being doing analysis on very large data sets.

50
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:35,320
It's not enough to just do an analysis, I want you to be able to present the results of your analysis both through visuals,

51
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:42,130
charts and graphics and the written argument to be able to communicate to other people,

52
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:48,910
your peers and the class myself in the future, your advisers, your supervisors at work,

53
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:56,650
what it is that you learn from the data and why your conclusions are a reliable and defensible interpretation of the data.

54
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,640
I want you to be able to identify weaknesses in data analysis.

55
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,990
No data analysis is perfect.

56
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:10,710
There are going to be weaknesses and downsides and we'll have to make tradeoffs when we make decisions of how we analyze the data,

57
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:19,480
but also not all weaknesses are created equal. I want you to be able to assess whether the impact a weakness has on the correctness and utility.

58
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,530
The result? Some weaknesses are fatal flaws, so we can no longer trust the results we get.

59
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,640
Other weaknesses, however, are.

60
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:37,650
Caveats that we need to acknowledge and account for when we apply the results, but they don't fundamentally undermine their validity.

61
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,600
I also want you to be able to reason about the ethical implications of your work.

62
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,560
There's a variety of different frameworks and perspectives that we can take on the

63
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,920
ethics of data science work that we're going to be talking about this semester.

64
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:57,450
But I want you to be able to think about and account for and assess the ethical implications of data science work.

65
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:03,900
And then finally, I want you to understand how various the broader picture of data science,

66
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:11,580
the various techniques and applications fit into a framework to give you a map of the of the space,

67
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,560
and particularly with the role this class plays in Boise State's graduate curriculum.

68
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,890
I want you I want to give you a framework that you can use to relate what you're going to learn in other classes,

69
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,480
such as machine learning or large scale data analysis or recommender systems or social

70
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,790
media mining together and develop a coherent picture of what it is to do data science.

71
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,590
Support these outcomes, there are a number of components of the class. The first is the videos and readings.

72
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,990
You're watching one of those videos right now. This is going to be the primary mechanism for content delivery.

73
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:51,200
I'm not planning to lecture live in class. I'll be doing a little bit of lecture style things here and there as we need to

74
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,610
clear up things that that are confusing or things you have questions about.

75
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,800
But our primary content delivery is going to be through these prerecorded lecture videos.

76
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,780
The website is your guide to all of this. Each week is going to have a page that lays out the videos,

77
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,760
the readings that you need to do in order to be prepared for class, prepared for the assignments and to learn the material.

78
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,120
Are in class, meetings are going to be focused on discussing and applying the materials, some of that will be open discussion,

79
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,790
some of that will be guided application exercises particularly carried out with your classmates.

80
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,860
We're going to be having some quizzes, particularly each Thursday.

81
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,250
There's going to be a quiz before class that assesses your understanding of the material and give both

82
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,730
you and I an initial check on how well your understanding it and whether you're ready to apply it.

83
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,560
In our work and in the assignment,

84
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,110
we're going to have assignments that come at a relatively steady pace throughout the semester, one every other week.

85
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,550
They give you more extended place to practice and develop your skills and demonstrate

86
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,990
your mastery of the material that we're going to be covering this semester. And then finally,

87
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:06,680
we have two midterm exams that a final exam to give an additional check of your conceptual knowledge of what it is that we're doing in this class.

88
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,450
As we go through the semester,

89
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,950
I expect you're probably going to have questions and you're going to need some help and there's a variety of places you can get it.

90
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,760
You can get it in our class meetings, both from your peers in the class and from me.

91
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,630
You can get it at any time through the class forum on Piazza.

92
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:29,330
I strongly encourage you to ask questions and answer each other's questions on Piazza when you ask a question,

93
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:35,510
I'm probably not going to answer it immediately. I'm going to give some time in order to see if others have an answer first.

94
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:41,150
Oftentimes, helping other people answer questions strengthens our own understanding of the material.

95
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:46,790
So I encourage you to make use of Piazza both to answer your get your questions answered

96
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,990
and to develop and practice your understanding of the material through helping each other.

97
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,180
I am going to be having office hours. I'm going to be having them physically in my office so long as health permits.

98
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,710
And I will also be able to have remote office hours by appointment.

99
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,670
I do ask that if you have any inquiries about the class that you direct them through Piazza.

100
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,080
If it's something that's just for me, perhaps about grades or something,

101
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,020
you can send a private message to the instructors on Piazza that's going to let me keep all

102
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,170
my course communications in one place so I don't accidentally lose something in my email.

103
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,180
And finally, you can use the Internet as a resource where there's a lot of documentation, resources.

104
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:31,860
Many of our readings are going to come from various places on the Internet. There's many more sites where you can search for solutions and help also.

105
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,140
I encourage you to make use of public Q&A sites when you're a practicing data scientist after this class.

106
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,960
The Internet is at your disposal for getting your work done.

107
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:47,600
There's no reason not to go ahead and practice, make use of the resources that are available to you in this class.

108
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,920
I just ask that you do it in a way that's in keeping with the principles of academic integrity,

109
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,240
you can go to a public Q&A site and you can ask, I'm trying to do this thing.

110
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:05,100
I'm having a problem. And ask a specific question about the problem that you're getting stuck on.

111
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,660
I don't want you to just copy copying a piece of the assignment description pasted in a question answer site and ask, how do I do this?

112
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:19,410
Demonstrate your learning of the material and how you go about identifying where it is that you're stuck and

113
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:26,520
asking a question that's going to help uncover the missing piece that you need in order to move forward.

114
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:34,030
So it's all of that. This class is designed to provide flexibility in learning and to use each modality to its best advantage.

115
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,180
There are tradeoffs. I'm not going to pretend like there's no trade off the how I've designed this class.

116
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,920
But with this design, we can do the content delivery me lecturing in a way where you can go back and watch videos later.

117
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,330
You can catch up. If you have to miss some material, you can speed up the video.

118
00:11:51,330 --> 00:12:02,400
If I talk to slow. And we're going to focus our in class time on things that can only be done through Synchronoss discussion.

119
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,270
Where we're actually engaging with the material together and talking to each

120
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,560
other about it and these things together with the various parts of the class,

121
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,020
I hope are going to allow us to achieve our learning outcomes for the semester. I hope you have a great semester.

122
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,070
I hope you learn a lot. I also expect to learn from you every time I teach.

123
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:28,050
It's a learning experience for me as well. And I learn more about the subject and about how to teach and communicate about it from my students.

124
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:34,900
So let's learn together.
