Outcome Variables
Continuous — regression
Categorical — classification
Two-level category (or ordinal) is binary classification
Multi-level ordinal — ordinal regression
Multi-level categorical — multi-class classification

Sometimes we’ll simplify to binary problem!
“mostly fresh”: % Fresh greater than 50%



Groups and Classes
Inference
What is the difference?
t-tests etc.
