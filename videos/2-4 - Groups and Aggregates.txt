Data Frame
Aggregates
What’s the mean rating?

ratings['rating'].mean()

Use data frame
Select column rating
Compute mean

What’s the conceptual problem here?
Aggregate Functions
Many aggregates:
mean
median
mode
min / max
sum
count
std (standard deviation)
var (variance)
All are methods on pandas Series.
Count and Length
Total size of series, including missing values:
series.size
len(series)

Number of values, not including missing data:
series.count()
Quantiles
Grouped Aggregates
Remember: # of ratings per movie could be a movie variable?

ratings.groupby('movieId')['rating'].count()

Yields a Series:
indexed by movieId
Values are # of ratings per movie
We’re only aggregating one series
If we did the other way, we wouldn’t have a movieid to group by!
Multiple Aggregates
See notebook…
Sorting
Sometimes we want to sort data:
sort_values(col) re-sorts the data

Sometimes we just need that to get the largest or smallest:
nlargest(n, col) gets n rows with largest values of col
nsmallest(n, col) gets the smallest
Joining
Joining two frames lets us combine data
Simplest: join on common index
set_index sets the index
join joins two frames (by default on their indexes)
Can specify join columns

More later (including in readings)
Aggregating Aggregates
Our movie-level rating statistics are just more variables!

That can be aggregated.

Practice: compute the mean # of ratings per movie
Wrapping Up
Aggregates combine a series or array into a single value

Can compute over whole series, or over groups.

Join combines frames
