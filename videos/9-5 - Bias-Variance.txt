Replication
Remember bootstrapping and simulation?
Repeated samples
Compute expectation, variance, etc. of parameters

What about prediction?

Wrapping Up
Expected test error is the error we expect from predicting new, unobserved data points.

When training from samples, expected error can be decomposed into model bias, model variance, and noise.
