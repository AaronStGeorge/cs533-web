1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:12,280
This video, we're going to start to getting to actually being able to augment our statistic with come

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,130
up with a measure of the confidence we have with regards to how it relates to the mean.

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,970
These are going to be extremely subtle to interpret correctly,

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:33,130
but they do get us towards being able to say things more robustly about the relationship of our estimate,

5
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,790
the statistic and the parameter that we're trying to estimate.

6
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,800
So our goals with for this lecture are for you to be able computer confidence interval for the mean,

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:50,190
using the standard error and correctly interpret a confidence interval. So let's return to our sample of the populations.

8
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,870
We've got our penguins and and we've got we're sampling our penguins and we're computing a statistic.

9
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,670
One question we can ask is, how does the statistic relate to the underlying parameter?

10
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,940
So this is important to be able to do inferences that can compute the mean flipper length of chinstrap penguins.

11
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,780
But how does that relate to the main flipper length of chinstrap penguins?

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,720
Well, the chinstrap penguins in the world world,

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:23,800
so classical frequenters statistics does this by thinking about what would happen if we repeated the experiment multiple times.

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:30,640
So let's say you want to measure penguins and I'm a penguin measuring robot.

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,500
And you tell me to go man, to go collect a measure that the flipper thinks and 50 penguins.

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,880
And you tell me to do that a hundred a hundred times each time taking a different random sample of penguins.

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,770
This allows us to the.

18
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,870
The mean flipper lengths I come back to you with are going to have a distribution.

19
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:59,630
So we have the flipper lengths, have a distribution. We go and we've you go have your your penguin measuring robot.

20
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:07,070
Go sample 50 penguins could measure the flipper lengths and give you the mean hundred times.

21
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:13,310
That also was going to have a distribution and we call this the sampling distribution of the statistic,

22
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,860
because it's what happens when we compute the sample, the statistic of our sample.

23
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,900
And we do it repeatedly.

24
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:30,800
And so this chart shows us the blue line, which you kind of can't see very well, because it's right up with the orange line is getting at the.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,490
There you can see they're slightly different. The blue line is the true population.

26
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,420
So here are my samples are being drawn from a random number generator that I've configured.

27
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,410
So I know the population distribution. Precisely. We have the sample.

28
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:51,100
The sample is the orange histograms and there's an orange density estimate on top of them, so.

29
00:02:51,100 --> 00:03:03,220
That's the sample itself. That's the distribution of values in my sample. And this is this is with 50 a sample size of 50, this green distribution.

30
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,060
That is the sampling distribution of the sample mean.

31
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:15,680
And so if I were to take one hundred of these orange samples or a thousand of these orange samples.

32
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,940
The green curve is the distribution, the means of those samples.

33
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,740
What have. So, yeah, as I said, we take a sample, we compute the experiment,

34
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:34,200
and we think about what the distribution is of the statistic from compute, from repeatedly doing this experiment.

35
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,540
So the sampling distribution of the sample mean. So we take a sample of size N and we compute the sample mean X bar.

36
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:50,760
This the sampling distribution is normal and it has a mean of the population mean.

37
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:59,910
And a standard deviation. Of the population, standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.

38
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:07,320
So. And also, for this to be true, X does not need to be normal.

39
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,250
And this is starting to get at what I mentioned in the previous video about the

40
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,810
precision and the accuracy of our estimate does not depend on the population size.

41
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:24,330
So. If the population has a standard deviation of one and we take sample sizes of size one hundred.

42
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:31,210
Then there's the means from those samples is going are going to be normally distributed with standard deviation.

43
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,820
One tenth, regardless of how big the population is.

44
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:46,870
The only variable to compute how far our our sample mean is likely to be the only things we need to compute.

45
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,340
How far our sample mean is likely to be from the true mean.

46
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:57,130
Are this this standard deviation of the population and the size of the sample?

47
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:03,510
We don't actually need the size of the population.

48
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:13,800
So but we don't have the population mean and the population standard deviation to be able to use that distribution directly.

49
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:22,440
But what we do compute is a confidence interval. And so while the sampling distribution lets us say things about the distribution

50
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,020
of the sampling mean and what happens if I compute a thousand of those means?

51
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,580
The confidence interval is also something that we understand in terms of what were to happen

52
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,730
wouldn't if we did it in infinitely many or sufficiently close to infinitely many times.

53
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,010
And so you compute a confidence dance interval with this statistic.

54
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:49,830
And this piece here asks over the square root of N is the standard error.

55
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,670
So. And our distribution here,

56
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:04,140
we have the standard deviation over the square root of N and that is that's really the error that what that's doing is it's bounding the error.

57
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,450
We're going to have and trying to estimate the mean or it's not bounding.

58
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:18,230
It's characterizing the error. We're going to how we expect to have when we're using the sample, mean to estimate the true mean.

59
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:28,690
So we call an estimate of that statistic using the sample standard deviation, we call this the standard error.

60
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:37,960
And the standard error is approximately the sample standard deviation of the sampling distribution,

61
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:48,100
one point nine six comes from the definition of it comes from the normal distribution in a standard normal.

62
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,460
Ninety five percent of the probability Nasse is between plus and minus one point nine six.

63
00:06:52,460 --> 00:07:00,830
But if we computer confidence interval in this way. So we. So if we say X bar, the mean plus or minus one point nine, six times the standard error.

64
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:07,180
That gives us an interval upper and lower bounds. So for our chinstrap penguins, we have a mean of one in nine five point eight.

65
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:15,950
Two, we have a standard deviation sample size. And we can computer standard error so that we can say that that was a standard error.

66
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,800
And the confidence interval,

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:26,060
so we can say our chinstrap penguin confidence interval is one point nine five point eight two plus or minus one point six nine.

68
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:33,290
And what the confidence interval means is it's the result of a procedure that we can perform.

69
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,540
And remember our little penguin measuring robot?

70
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:45,300
Well, if we had the penguin measuring robot returned the confidence interval instead of the the mean itself.

71
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:56,170
And we have it go measure confident, we have it go measure penguins, sample penguins and measure them a thousand times.

72
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,640
Nine hundred and fifty of the confidence intervals that it gives us approximately.

73
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,390
This is all probabilistic, so it might be a little more, a little less,

74
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:14,050
but approximately ninety five percent of the confidence intervals that it gives us contain the true mean flipper length for a chinstrap penguin.

75
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:20,140
That's what the confidence interval means. And so the width of this interval is an estimate of our precision.

76
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:27,060
It's really important to understand a couple of things. It's really important to understand a couple of things.

77
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:35,990
One, the it is not we are not 95 percent confident the mean Lise's in the interval.

78
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,280
Then it is not that the mean lies within the interval with probability point nine five.

79
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,800
That would be another thing related thing called a baozi incredible interval.

80
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,830
It also isn't precisely a statement about X Bar itself. What the confidence interval means is.

81
00:08:53,830 --> 00:09:06,370
It's an interval generated from a using a procedure that ninety five percent of the time will include the mean with the true mean within the interval.

82
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,600
So a brief aside, I mentioned the population standard deviation,

83
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,400
which we usually don't know because we don't have the population and the sample standard deviation,

84
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,820
and there's actually a slight difference in how we compute them in the samples that we're computing, the standard deviation from a sample.

85
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,660
We divide by N minus one instead of N.

86
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:34,840
And this is the key reason for this is that the samples to the standard sample standard deviation has what we call N minus one degrees of freedom.

87
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,990
Because we've already computed X bar. This is an intermediate statistic.

88
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:46,170
That we've already computed.

89
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:58,760
Given X bar and X one through N minus one, you can solve for X and only and minus one of the of the sample values are allowed to vary.

90
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:06,980
And still have the same X bar. And so because we have this is called degrees of freedom, because we have N minus one degrees of freedom.

91
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,350
We. We can.

92
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,760
We have to divide back and minus one. No, they think of it since X Bar is computed from the X's.

93
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,280
The Xs are not independent of X Bar in the population.

94
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,770
The the the the instances are independent of each other, given the mean.

95
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,830
But in this in the sample they aren't because we could given we can compute the last one.

96
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:40,600
If we had the mean and we have the first ten minus one. So we can start to compare values based on confidence intervals.

97
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,790
So I computed here the confidence intervals for the flipper lengths for our three types of penguins.

98
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:52,540
And there's no overlap in the confidence intervals. This is evidence that the flipper that the penguins have different flipper lengths.

99
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:59,470
If they had the same if they tended to have the same flipper length, then of the confidence interval would probably overlap.

100
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,220
We're gonna see later methods for directly comparing two means.

101
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,570
But we can start by using the confidence interval to see. OK.

102
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,050
Do they overlap? And the confidence interval also allows us to estimate if it's different.

103
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,710
If it if it's far away from a value. If we've.

104
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:22,480
If. The confidence interval, the low or high end of it, is pretty far from zero.

105
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,380
Then a reasonably far from zero, then zeroes. Probably not.

106
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:34,280
I mean. So but as I said, we have to be really, really careful about how we interpret confidence intervals.

107
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,520
We take us. The procedure is take a sample of size n compute the statistic infinitely many times.

108
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,090
Ninety five percent. In this case, the statistic is the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.

109
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,470
Ninety five percent of the time, the Trumaine will be in this interval.

110
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,470
Ninety five percent of the time this procedure will return an interval that contains the true mean.

111
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,290
We could also have other confidence interval, such as a ninety nine percent one.

112
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:11,590
But as I said, the confidence interval is not where we're 95 percent sure that parameter is.

113
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:21,250
We also have a couple of outstanding issues with the confidence interval.

114
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:28,150
So to wrap up, taking a sample and computing a statistic is a random process that results in a sampling distribution.

115
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,200
And this is the sampling distribution is the probability distribution from the process.

116
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:39,910
Take a sample and computer statistic. We can use this to try to start estimating the precision of our of our estimates.

117
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,450
So we have the X bar, which is Selke. This is my estimate for the main.

118
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,210
Mina, the penguins I saw were gonna use that as the estimate for the mean of penguins.

119
00:12:50,210 --> 00:13:06,970
But we can use knowledge of the sampling process to develop techniques that let us not only estimate but estimate how far off our estimate is.
