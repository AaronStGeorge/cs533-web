Sampling Distributions
How does a statistic relate to the underlying parameter?

Classical frequentist statistics considers the outcome of repeating the experiment.

This gives us the sampling distribution of the statistic.

Comparing Confidence
The confidence intervals do not overlap.

This is evidence that the species have different flipper lengths.

We’ll see a direct comparison later.
Interpreting Confidence
Wrapping Up
Taking a sample and computing a statistic is a random process that results in a sampling distribution.

We can use the sampling distribution to estimate the precision of an estimate (e.g. statistic estimating a parameter).
