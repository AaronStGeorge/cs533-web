Purposes of Data Presentation
Guide reader attention to important results
Focus
Make it easy to ask the key questions
Substantiate results and conclusions
Do so with integrity
Audiences
Youâ€™ll need to present data to several audiences:

Yourself
Your collaborators, supervisors, etc.
Expert readers (know subject, not your work)
Decision-makers
The general public
Guiding Questions
What did you seek to find out?
What did you learn?
Why should the reader trust your conclusions?

Presentation with integrity shows the reader what you learned.
Dishonest presentation manipulates them.

Wrapping Up
The goal of good presentation is to guide the reader to what we learned and how we know it.

Effective presentation will highlight the important things without distraction or deception.
