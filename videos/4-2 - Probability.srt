00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:10,690
Also in this video, I went to talk with you about the basic principles of probability to lay a foundation for some

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,950
of the reasoning we're going to need to do this week and throughout the rest of the semester.

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,330
So we're learning outcomes for this video are for you to know the fundamentals, set operations.

4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,250
We're going to use sets to discuss logical events that become the basis of probability

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,690
and to know the fundamental public concepts of probability theory for single events.

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,500
So to introduce a set, a set is an unordered collection of distinct elements.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,590
There's no duplicates in it. So if A were to somehow be twice in a collection, it's not a set.

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,420
And also the elements have no intrinsic order. We can impose an order for Elst from elsewhere.

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,710
But if we have a set, there's no intrinsic order to the elements in it by default.

10
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:55,850
We then in a few relationships around sets, if we can say that an element A is a member of a set.

11
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:02,330
We can say that one set is a subset of or another. We can also compute the size or the cardinality of a set.

12
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,830
Now, sets can be infinite. That is, they can contain infinitely many elements.

13
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,370
There are also multiple types or sizes of infinity.

14
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,290
The smallest infinity is what we call countable infinity.

15
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,130
And the countable infinity is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.

16
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,590
So zero one or one, two, three, four or five on forever.

17
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,130
There are accountably, many such numbers. That's the smallest infinity.

18
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,170
There are larger infinities. The details of that aren't going to be superimportant. They're going to come up once or twice.

19
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,790
But this is not an advanced. We're not going to dove deep. But I.

20
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,220
I might need the word accountably occasionally. We then have several operations onsets.

21
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,150
So A Union B is the number is the set of items.

22
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,290
That's an either A or B or both. It can be a both. Can be an either of them.

23
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,480
The intersection is the items that are in both of the sets. And then we have the set difference.

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,770
The items that are in A but not in B Union, an intersection are both symmetrical.

25
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,880
You can swap the the sets around. Difference is not symmetrical.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,610
And then we have the complement.

27
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:17,140
If A is a subset of some larger set, some universe than the set of all items, not in a universe minus A is a complement.

28
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:23,410
Now, with these sets, we can then start to talk about what we call events.

29
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,100
So probability is the probability theory.

30
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:35,920
We talk about the probability of events. And so we have a set of elementary events and these are the distinct individual outcomes.

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,710
For example, if we flip a coin, are elementary events are heads and tails.

32
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:48,080
If we roll a six sided die or elementary events are one, two, three, four, five, six.

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:56,090
But then an event is a set that is a subset of our set of elementary events and the elementary events themselves.

34
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,970
We don't treat those as events. We make Singleton sets. So we just have the set that just contains H.

35
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:10,130
And that's going to be the coin is heads. But this way we can talk about events that are combinations of others,

36
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,740
such as E itself, the set of all the elementary events that mean something happened.

37
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,770
It doesn't matter what happened, just something happened.

38
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:28,160
And the also we can talk about, for example, two four six is the event if we're have our dice, two four six,

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:35,620
the SEC containing those three dicer die rolls is the event road even number because the hole at the elementary events.

40
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,000
So the individual rolls. One, two, three, four, five, six. There are three of them that are even two, four and six.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,500
And so we can say the set of those three is the event rolled even number.

42
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,560
So we think about events. We're going to talk about events in terms of these sets.

43
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,180
And you set notation to talk about the combinations of events.

44
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:03,550
This is going to build up the basis of our probability theory. So then set operations described logical events.

45
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:09,050
So A, Intersect B means both A and B happened at the same time.

46
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,640
We have a A as a set of elementary events where some property is true,

47
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:21,110
say even B is a set where some other property is true, say divisible by three, A Intersect.

48
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,740
B is the set or both properties are true. This set may be empty.

49
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,200
But in this case, even in divisible by three is gonna be a six.

50
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:40,850
A Union B is either a C, so intersection is equivalent to logical and a union B is either A or B happened or both.

51
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,350
If it's possible for them to both have it at the same time, it might be that both happen, but at least one of them happened.

52
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:56,990
This is logical. Or we can also we also have A happened, but not B, so if A is even and B is divisible by three A but not B would be three.

53
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:04,950
Excuse me, A, but not B would be two and four because two and four of the even numbers that are not divisible by three.

54
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:12,800
As I said, these are equivalent to the logical operators, so A and B, A or B and then A and not B.

55
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,630
So we have these these individual outcomes, the elementary events.

56
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,370
We have the events themselves that are subsets of it. We then decide this D.

57
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,510
Define a set F. That is going to be the set of all possible events.

58
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:35,960
These are subsets of E! So this is a set of stats. And this set has to has an important property.

59
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,780
It's closed under. So first E is in it. So E is is an F.

60
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,650
And it is closed under complement and countable unions. So if.

61
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,830
If set A is in this field F. Then its complement is as well.

62
00:05:52,830 --> 00:06:05,440
So E minus A is in it. The way we think of that, if a as say, even if even as an event, while odd, is an event to.

63
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,350
Also, if we have. Solemn events, then their union is also an event.

64
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:18,500
So if and also if if it is infinite, then this is count what accountable union?

65
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,170
Any count? Any any collection of counterplay many events. Their union is an event.

66
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,390
The details of that ring will save for a probability theory course.

67
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:38,440
But to be complete, there it is. We call this this field f a sigma field or a sigma algebra.

68
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,500
But. But F, is this the setup?

69
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:55,000
This collection of events? So we the in The Incredibles, you have the guy, the father, he comes home and the kids waiting there and.

70
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,110
What are you waiting for? I know something amazing, I guess. Well, something amazing.

71
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:05,210
It is an event that set off all elementary events that are amazing for whatever amazing means.

72
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,400
But then that also means that something not amazing, maybe something boring is also an event.

73
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:21,550
So you get this compliment thing. Like if. If, if. The set of all monetary events with some property say amazing is an event.

74
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,760
Well, the set of all of them that don't have that property also is.

75
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,540
So if we have our six sided die, we have the elementary events of the three or the six different values.

76
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:40,370
All of the singletons are events. They're all in our field and also all subsets of e wind up being events.

77
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:51,860
This we call this the powers. The power set is the set of all subsets. So there's any subset of E is an event.

78
00:07:51,860 --> 00:08:00,470
And if you have it, so long as our set of elementary events is discrete and finite, all of the subsets are going to be events.

79
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:06,260
So let's I want to show you quick a theorem that we can prove already with the values that we have so far.

80
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:13,180
So if we have two events, a one and a two. The axioms told us it's usually the definition of a sigma field.

81
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,390
Told us that their union is an event,

82
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:24,170
but also their intersection is an event because the intersection can be turned into a compliment of a union of compliments by the Morgens laws.

83
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,930
If you've taken the logic class, you might remember those.

84
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:37,660
The compliments are in the hour in the field by club because the field has all the compliments in it.

85
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,090
The union of Compliments, therefore, is also in the field since it's in the field, its complement.

86
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:51,480
The intersection is in the field. So from the axioms we have, we can prove that the intersection is is an event.

87
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,530
So with these fields, we can now define probability and a probability is a measure of we call it actually a measure.

88
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:05,070
So it's a probability measure. But it's a measure of how likely the different events are.

89
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,860
So a probability distribution. It's a function over this field F and it obeys a few rules.

90
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:17,070
The probability of E the set of all elementary events is one. Basically, if we got something happening.

91
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,350
Well, the probability of something happening again, observe something happening is one.

92
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,570
Also, probabilities are not negative. All probabilities are at least zero.

93
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:33,960
And then if we have a disjoint sets or disjoint events.

94
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,270
So two events are disjoint. If they're mutually exclusive, they can't both happen at the same time.

95
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:47,460
Their intersection is empty. If we have to decide if we have disjoint events, then the probability of their union.

96
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,770
So if A and B are disjoint, the probability of A or B happening is the probability of A plus.

97
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,510
The probability of B. So for disjoint events, events, that cannot happen.

98
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:06,970
At the same time, we sum up their individual property probabilities to get the probability of any of them happening.

99
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:14,080
So if we're going to apply this to our DI, the problem, if we have all our singletons sets set containing just the value one,

100
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,920
two, three, four, five, six, the probability of each of these is one sixth.

101
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,180
The Dyas is fair. All values are equally likely. So the probability of even we're going to stay.

102
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:32,890
Even the set of even dice is one half because three of the six equally likely values one, two, three, four, five, six are even.

103
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,240
So we have when all the values are equally likely, we can count up to par.

104
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:44,320
The number of possibilities where our action, where our property happens, divided by the total number of possibilities.

105
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,190
And that gives us the probability. If they're not all equally likely, then things quickly get more subtle.

106
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,540
One consequence of this, another theorem that we can prove is that probabilities are not greater than one.

107
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,920
So. And I'm going to let you study the proof here in the slides, Off-line.

108
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,760
But we can prove from those axioms that probabilities are not greater than one.

109
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,520
And so this gives us a few different facts about probability. Probabilities are in the range zero to one.

110
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,330
If we have the union of two probability of two events there,

111
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:28,590
the probability of the union is the sum of the individual probabilities, minus the probability of A and B.

112
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm going to let you think about why this is true. And we can talk about it in the discussion.

113
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,330
This also gives us that the probability of. A or B?

114
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:46,430
Is less than or equal to the probability of a plus the probability of B.

115
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:52,430
You can see that because the probabilities are at least zero, then P of A plus P, a,

116
00:11:52,430 --> 00:12:03,290
B plus P of A or B or minus P of A and B is going to be no more than P of A plus people P plus P of beef.

117
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,150
The probability of a compliment is one minus the probability of the original thing.

118
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:16,580
We can compute the probability of of a difference. And we can also have an inequality relationship for subsets of fey as a subset of B.

119
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:24,990
It's probability is no greater than the probability of B. So what does probability mean so far, I've given you these rules.

120
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,390
It's just a function from sets of values. It turns out this is a surprisingly deep philosophical question,

121
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:38,740
but the depth of the philosophical question doesn't have to stop us from using it basically in two broad views,

122
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,700
which for our purposes are not going to conflict that much are that it's the expected or long run outcome of a random process.

123
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:55,390
And so. Probability of a Diab being one six means if we go, we roll six, the dice six hundred times.

124
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:03,980
We expect about a hundred of those to be one. It also can describe a degree of belief or expectation.

125
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:13,600
So that then that is a more subjective view on it that connects to the probability is is

126
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,160
describing what I know about what's going to happen when I roll the dice to wrap up,

127
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,740
though, we can use we can use sets to describe events or outcomes in their logical combinations.

128
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:35,110
We can then use probability to quantify the likelihood of different events and probabilities, follow a number of rules with rich emergent properties.

129
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:46,328
We're going to see more notions of probability and things we can do with it in the subsequent videos.
