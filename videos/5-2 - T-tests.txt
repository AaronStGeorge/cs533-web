Tests
One sample, mean: one-sample t-test
Scipy ttest_1samp
Paired measurements: paired t-test
Scipy ttest_rel, or use 1samp on differences
Two independent samples: two-sample independent t-test
Scipy ttest_ind
Warning: assumes equal variance by default â€“ turn off with equal_var=False
Other Tests
This is the usual practice for a significance test:
Compute statistic
Compare to distribution under null hypothesis

Can bootstrap them too
Wrapping Up
Significance tests compute the probability of a statistic under the null hypothesis.

The T-test does this with the t-statistic, a standardized mean.
