00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:13,570
Hello, in this video, I want to talk about the concept of distribute, particularly named distributions, we introduced the fundamentals of probability.

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,590
We've gotten the continuous variables and random variables.

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,770
I want to talk about what it means when we talk about something, say, having the normal distribution.

4
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,690
And so our learning outcomes for this video were to understand the idea of a distribution,

5
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,500
to be able to identify parameters and statistics of a distribution.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:42,100
The notebook and the linked reading have the linked material, has more information, more information on these distributions, many more distributions.

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,320
So I encourage you to spend some time exploring that particular distribution.

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,670
Families are one place where Wikipedia is a rather fantastic resource.

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:01:01,480
I've included a link to Wikipedia's list of probability distributions, which is organized by by distribution type.

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:10,990
And it each of the pages provides rather mathematically dense but useful detail on how the distribution is defined.

11
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,810
Some of its key properties and relationships to other distributions.

12
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:23,070
So but to get started, this idea of working me, focusing on distributions of numeric variables.

13
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,650
These can be both discrete and continuous. So discrete. We might have a distribution of accounts.

14
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,640
It can also be categorical so long as we encode them as a numbers.

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,580
So we may encode a a success or failure outcome as zero for failure and one for success.

16
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,930
Speaking of which, the banali distribution does exactly like it does exactly that.

17
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:51,340
If we have binary outcomes. Success and failure, which we code as one and zero respectively by convention.

18
00:01:51,340 --> 00:02:00,480
And we have a parameter, the success probability. Then we have we can then also compute some statistics of this distribution.

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:09,370
Its mean, which is since the outcomes are just zero and one, it would be the fraction in the long run, run it infinitely many times.

20
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:15,910
What fraction would you expect to be successes? And then it'll also have a mode, which is the value that's going to occur more often.

21
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,240
For example, when Theta is point three, the mode is failure.

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,820
There are a few things we want to do to characterize the distribution. So we have its parameters.

23
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,280
So in the Bernoulli distribution, the parameter was the success probability. There are other parameters as well,

24
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,780
and some of the parameters come in particular types such as location and location

25
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:46,320
is a parameter that controls where on the x axis the distribution is located.

26
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:54,300
Sometimes it is the mean, but not always. The key thing is that the location parameter controls where on the x axis.

27
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,900
So it slides it back and forth in the x axis, some distribution. It's also going to change the shape somewhat as it slides.

28
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:09,030
But the location parameter controls where on the x axis it is the scale parameter controls,

29
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,310
how far, how wide it is, how far out it spreads out its density.

30
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,820
Some distributions called location scale distributions are controlled by location and scale parameters.

31
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,160
And the shape of the distribution doesn't change it at all, doesn't changes all at all as you move it around,

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,450
the location just shifts the same curve back and forth on the x axis.

33
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,940
And the the scale just spreads it out or contracts it on the x axis.

34
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,160
And so if you if you do a simple way of plotting it, the curve is gonna be exactly the same.

35
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,050
The X axis is just going to be shifted and smushed or spread out underneath the curve.

36
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,800
And then a shape parameter controls the shape of the distribution.

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,640
So this distribution, which is a normal distribution, doesn't have a shape parameter,

38
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:03,990
but there's a skewed normal which adds a shape parameter to let you get shapes like this.

39
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:12,030
And in it, that shape parameter allows you to shift between the normal, the traditional normal and this skewed normal.

40
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,820
And so there's other types of parameters as well. But three common kinds of these location, scale and shape parameters,

41
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:25,740
locations where scale is how wide and then shape is what it's actually shaped like there.

42
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,160
We then to characterize the distribution,

43
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:37,980
we have a density or a mass function that use probability density or probability mass function that uses these parameters to assign probability,

44
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:45,720
mass or density to different values. We then have what's called the support, which is the range of values the distribution is defined over.

45
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,670
Not all distributions are defined over the same range.

46
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,960
And there's often we want to it's useful to think about the underlying random process.

47
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,510
Most distributions are described as the result of a particular random process.

48
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,350
It does not mean those processes are the only things they're useful for describing,

49
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,530
but it's mathematically the distribution arises from analyzing that particular process.

50
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,680
We then can compute some statistics of a distribution.

51
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,650
It's mean the expected value of a very of a random variable with that distribution is one of them.

52
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:27,660
It's also called the first moment of the distribution. Then we can compute the standard deviation or variance.

53
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,120
For some distributions, for example, normal, though,

54
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,950
it has location and scale parameters that are the mean and standard deviation, the variance is called the second central moment.

55
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:51,980
We can also compute other things, such as the median or the fiftieth percentile of the distribution in other and quintiles.

56
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,090
So the binomial distribution is we take that Bernoulli and we stretch.

57
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:03,470
We do it multiple times. The binomial distribution is it has the parameters and which is the number of trials.

58
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:10,190
The number of Bernoulli trials we're going to run. And Theta is the success probability of each individual trial.

59
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:20,000
The trials are assumed to be independent and the burn the binomial distribution describes the distribution of how many successes.

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,560
We'll see if we run that many trials with that success probability.

61
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:32,630
It's mass function is. The probability of success times the number of successes.

62
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:41,210
The probability of failure times the number of failures and then multiplied by end, choose why and choose why.

63
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:53,540
Is the number of possible ways to arrange why failures out of any successes so.

64
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:06,080
So that's a probability mass function I show here. Also, the DI a graph of it's you can see where how the mass is distributed for N equals 10.

65
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,250
And Theta equals zero point three.

66
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:16,090
So you can see three. That's the mode, and that's also the mean and the median.

67
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,760
Three. If we flip awaited coin, that comes up heads 30 percent of the time.

68
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,060
Ten times three will be the most common number of heads.

69
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,670
But there's quite a bit of spread. We're going to see a lot of twos and a lot of fours as well.

70
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,760
And we'll see some runs with zero heads. We're not going to it's.

71
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:41,480
There is going to be very, very few runs that wind up having 10 heads with a coin with that bias.

72
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,410
The normal or the Gaussian distribution that I just showed you has mean and look, has its scale parameter or excuse me,

73
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:54,210
its location parameter is the means at scale parameter is the standard deviation.

74
00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:01,530
When the mean is zero and the standard deviation is one, we call this a standard normal.

75
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:14,920
And the stand I'm showing here, the standard normal with both the probability density function and the the distribution function, the CTF.

76
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,960
So you can see how those relate to each other of align them vertically.

77
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,410
The code to generate all of these plots is in their notebooks. You can see how I did them.

78
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:29,970
You will see we see here that the cumulative probability goes from zero to one.

79
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,960
Cumulative probability always does that. The density, the bell curve goes out to zero on both sides.

80
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,150
The density is concentrated in a particular window. And the.

81
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,620
And it's a density. So it goes up to whatever that the maximum density is.

82
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:58,500
If we if we contracted that, if if we decreased the scale, the density would increase, the maximum density would increase.

83
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,950
So to wrap up, random variables are often described where probability distributions, which are in turn governed by parameters.

84
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,980
There's quite a few different standard probability distributions.

85
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,920
I encourage you to spend some time with the notebook and the linked resources to learn more about different distributions.

86
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:23,943
And we're going to be introducing more as they come up for various things throughout the rest of the class.
