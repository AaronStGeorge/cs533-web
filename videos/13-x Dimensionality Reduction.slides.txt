What Is a Vector?
Homogenous and Heterogenous Vectors
An instance’s features form a vector (array of values)
Different features have different scales (unless standardized)
Not necessarily meaningful to relate to each other

Homogenous vector representations are particularly useful
All entries are the same ‘kind’ of thing
Positions instances in a vector space

Vectors
Can represent:
A point in space
A line from origin to point
Angles
Vector Similarity
Cosine similarity is a common measure of object similarity
How related are two vectors?
If vectors are mean-centered, equivalent to Pearson correlation

Very common to do with TF-IDF vectors to compare documents
What Is a Matrix?
Matrix Multiplication
Tricks
Dimensionality Reduction
Wrapping Up
Vector representations such as TF-IDF can be used for further computations.
