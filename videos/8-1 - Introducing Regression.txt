Variables and Model
What Is a Model?
A mathematical representation

Of the essential dynamics

Of a system of interest
Purposes of Modeling
Understand predictor/outcome relationships
Correlational, not causal (at least alone)
Predict future outcomes
Estimate hypothetical outcomes
Correct for effects for further analysis

Regression predicts (or estimates) a continuous variable
Linearity
Wrapping Up
Models summarize data generating processes and let us predict future outcomes.

Linear models are a particularly simple but flexible class of models.
