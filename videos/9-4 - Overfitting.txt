PREDICTION AND OVERFITTING
Learning Outcomes
Understand overfitting
Design an evaluation that reduces the likelihood of overfitting
Understand that we can overfit process not just an individual model

Prediction Goals
Predict future unseen data
We can just look at the data we have to learn about it
We want to forecast or predict the future

One way of thinking about generalizability

Predict
Test data is unseen

Can model generalize to it?
Fitting to Data
The model structure:
Choice of model (linear, tree, etc.)
Selection & transformation of features
Hyper-parameter values

The model parameters:
Coefficients learned from data

Both can overfit. Train-test addresses parameters.

Wrapping Up
Overfitting arises when our model learns too much, so it canâ€™t generalize to new data.

Splitting our data into training, tuning, and testing sets helps with this.
