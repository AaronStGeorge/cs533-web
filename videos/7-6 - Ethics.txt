Principles of Human Subjects Ethics
Respect for Persons
Individuals should be treated as autonomous agents
Persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection
Beneficence
Avoid harm, provide benefit
Justice
How are costs and benefits of research distributed?
See the Belmont Report
Informed Consent
Research subjects should
Be informed about the research
In terms they can understand
So they can voluntarily choose whether to participate

Compliance
Ethics is about doing the right thing

Compliance is about following rules and regulations

Some rules are to enforce a baseline of ethical behavior, but compliance is not ethics.
Regulation in US Federal Funding
Common Rule regulates federally-funded human subjects research
Organizations must have an Institutional Review Board (IRB)
IRB must approve human subjects research
Uses Belmont principles
Reviews consent procedures, analysis, etc.
Weighs risks and benefits

IRB approval does not mean something is ethical.
Human Subjects
U.S. Common Rule:
Human subject means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research:
(i) Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; or
(ii) Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.

Additional Relevant Concerns
Data protection regulation, law, and rights
EU GDPR
California, many jurisdictions have similar laws
Principles are broader than implementation
Contextual integrity — people may not expect data to be reused
Anti-discrimination (both law and principle)
Further development of respect and justice concerns
Pushing further on racial and gender justice
Wrapping Up
Our work has ethical implications.

It is our responsibility as scientists and as human beings to work through the ethics of our work and be accountable.

Rules and regulations can provide some guidance.
