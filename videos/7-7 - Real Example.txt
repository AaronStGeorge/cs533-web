Question
Are book authors of different genders well-represented in user ratings and reviews ratings in online book platforms?
Data Requirements
Books
“Easy” public data:
Library of Congress Open MARC Data (10.5M records)
OpenLibrary (26.7M records)
GoodReads (crawled by UCSD; limited data)
MARC
Standard format for book and author data
Stores data in fields and subfields with numeric tags
Available in XML format
Same structure and tags
Easier to parse w/ standard tools
Still must know MARC fields!

What is a Book?
LoC catalogs many things:
Books
Periodicals
Government records
Music
Films
A “book” is:
Textual (MARC format ‘t’)
Also included ‘a’ (Map) to catch atlases
Not a government record
International Standard Book Number (ISBN)
Identifies books across publishers
Defined to identify a single edition of a book
Come in 10- and 13-digit formats
13-digit is variant of EAN
Can convert 10 to 13
Problems:
Many formats, surrounding text, etc.
Corrupt ISBNs
Extra digits
Missing digits
Incorrect check digit
Non-ISBNs in ISBN field
$15


Other Identifiers
Library of Congress Control Number (LCCN)
OpenLibrary edition & work IDs
GoodReads book & work IDs
Our own table primary keys
Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)

Define unified book code – number identifying a book record

Cleaning ISBNs
Process ISBN fields:
Extract things that look like ISBNs
Digits, with allowable separators and terminating X
Long enough to be an ISBN
Extract “tags” (e.g. ‘pbk’)
Define allowable prefixes, postfixes, and separators
Clean junk and separators from inside ISBNs to standardize

Recursive descent parser driven by regular expressions (CS 361 & 354!)
Development Process
Start with simple rules
Manually verify some matches
Look for patterns not yet matched
Add to matcher!
Make ignore patterns for known-unparsable patterns
Iterate until everything is matched, ignored, or unusable
OpenLibrary
JSON – much easier to work with
Shares many ISBN problems – used same logic
What is a Book?
Books have multiple editions
Different publishers
Different ISBNs
Ratings / reviews usually attached to a single edition
OpenLibrary, GoodReads group into “work”
Not complete
Some records more complete than others
Best to recommend works
Grouping by Connected Components
Work
Work
Book
Book
Book
Book
ISBN
ISBN
ISBN
Each connected component gets a cluster identifier
Problems with Grouping
Miss groups when we don’t have records to link them
ISBN that never appears in any book data
Over-grouping when ISBNs are mislinked
ISBN erroneously recorded for wrong book
Two books’ ISBNs corrupted to same value
ISBN reuse
Combined volumes

Not yet good solutions – documented as limitation
Integration So Far
Book data from 3 sources
ISBNs (and ASINs) extracted 
Book records mapped into clusters
ISBN ⇔ cluster mapping (what ISBNs are in a cluster?)

This is (complex) pooling, but w/o standardization
Next: linking!
Book Ratings and Reviews
Collected from online platforms:
BookCrossing [BX] (collected from an old book rating site, often used for recommender systems research)
Amazon [AZ] (public ratings and reviews, collected by UCSD in 2014)
GoodReads [GR] (ratings, reviews, and add-to-shelf actions by users with public profiles, collected by UCSD in 2017)
BookCrossing and Amazon Linking
BX: user ID, ISBN, rating
ISBNs can be corrupt – remove invalid chars
Link to book clusters

AZ: user ID, ASIN, rating, review text
Treat as ISBNs
Link to book clusters

GoodReads Linking
GoodReads contains:
User adds book to shelf (user ID, book ID, shelf ID, timestamp)
Shelf IDs not meaningful
“Is Read” flag for adding to the Read shelf
5-star rating (accompanying some add-to-shelf actions)
Review text (with user ID, item ID, timestamp, rating)

All have GoodReads book IDs – directly link to cluster
Integration So Far
Book Cluster
LoC Book Records
OpenLib Edition Records
GoodReads Book Records
OpenLib Work Records
BookCrossing Ratings
Amazon Ratings & Reviews
GoodReads Ratings, Adds, Reviews
GoodReads Work Records
Author Data
Book data includes list of authors
OpenLibrary & GoodReads have author entries
Linked identifiers

But we want author gender — missing!

Let’s not guess from names.
Authority Records
Librarians create two kinds of records:
Bibliographic records about books
Name authority records about authors

More MARC, and… MARC Authority field 375 is “gender”!
Recording Gender
MARC Authority Field 375:
Defined as gender identity
Uses an open vocabulary
Allows for multiple gender records per author with validity dates

Program for Cooperative Cataloging Working Group provides guidance on filling the field

Un-Recording Gender
Library of Congress
PCC coordinates contributing libraries
Some contributors do not record gender
Only covers LoC collections

Virtual Internet Authority File
Combines LoC with other national libraries
Smashes all gender records into male/female without dates

Linking Authority
MARC records do not have linking identifiers
Bibliographic record stores author name
Authority record has control number, but it isn’t referenced

OpenLibrary records VIAF control numbers for a few authors
Linking by Name
Find VIAF record(s) with names matching first author’s name
Extract gender identity field

Assumption: it is unlikely for two authors to have the same full name and different genders.
Combine all matching gender records into male, female, ambiguous, or unknown
Only reasonable because of goal/question
Names
Authority records list multiple name variants for an author
OpenLibrary also lists multiple names for author
Book only lists one
Inconsistent on “Family, Given” or “Given Family”

Solution:
If authority record has “B, A”, generate additional “A B” name
Accept match on any name

First Author Gender
Measuring
Representation
Limitations
Over-links authors, which can cause some gender errors
Over-links books, causing some gender and book errors
Only records binary gender
Unknown gender distribution of unknown books
Presence of the label is probably biased, we don’t know how

LoC has linked data that should help; not yet publicly available
Software
Rust program
Parses raw data files
Loads into SQL database
Cleans ISBNs

Rust:
Compiled language (fast like C)
High-level features (memory management, types, strings, XML parsers, etc.)
PostgreSQL
Stores data
Extracts desired fields from natural objects
Integrates data sources

Python
Clusters books
Computes statistics
DVC controls whole process
Wrapping Up
Many decisions go into a serious data integration project.

Document and justify them all.

Design workflow to make it transparent and reproducible.
