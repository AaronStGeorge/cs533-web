Statistic
A statistic is a value computed from a collection of data

Often summarizes (observations of) a variable
Descriptive Questions
Where is the variable centered?
How large does it tend to be?
Called meaure of central tendency
How spread out is it?

Mean
What is a Mean?
What does the mean measure?
If every instance had the same value, what would it be?
“Points per player”

How do you change it?
Increase total (score more points)
It doesn’t matter where – one person can do all of it!
Spread - Variance and Standard Deviation
What is Variance?
What does variance measure?
The mean squared distance from the mean
If mean is center, how far away do values tend to be?
If mean is expectation, how far off does it tend to be?
Square penalizes large differences more
Standard deviation translates back to original units
Computing Statistics
Pandas:
Series.mean()
Series.std()
Series.var()

Note: np.std and np.var compute population std and var, not sample
Change with ddof=1

Outliers
Outliers are particularly large or small values

Outliers draw the mean towards them! (also affect SD)
Median
What value divides upper half from lower half?
Sort values
Pick middle one
If even number: take mean of middle 2

0  0  0  2  2  7  8  8  15  45

How to increase? Increase small values.
Spread – Range and IQR
The range is max – min

The inter-quartile range is distance between 1st and 3rd quartiles (width of “middle 50%”)

0  0  0  2  2  |  7  8  8  15  45

Mean, Median, and Skew
What question do we want to answer?
If we distributed the points equally, how many would each have?

If we randomly selected a player, are they equally likely to have more or less points?
Mode
The most common value
doesn’t work great for continuous values
fantastic for categorical variables!

Wrapping Up
Mean and median describe where a value tends to be.

Standard deviation, variance, range, and IQR measure how spread out it is.

Mean-based computationally useful; median-based robust to outliers.
