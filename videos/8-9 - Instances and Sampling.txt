INSTANCES AND SAMPLING
Learning Outcomes
Identify the instances in a data set
Determine the correct level at which to sample for the bootstrap or test data

Instances
An observation of a single thing
Has one or more variables
The variable values go together – row 0 is one penguin
Covariance / correlation measure intra-instance relationships
Sampling
Goal: bootstrap a confidence interval for flipper/mass correlation

Sample: penguin instances
Each bootstrap sample has n of them

Compute: correlation coefficient

CI is 95% interval of the bootstrap sample correlation coefficient
Bootstrapping Linear Models
We can bootstrap any statistic
Say, a linear model coefficient!
Sample rows (penguin instances)
Fit the model to each sample
Extract statistic
Can do multiple statistics simultaneously
Bootstrap Code
Related Quantities
We often compute relationships between variables of an instance
Paired t-test
Correlation coefficient
Linear regression

Keep instances together is the common rule
Bootstrap Components
Two pieces to a bootstrap design:
Statistic(s) to compute
Sampling strategy

To bootstrap a CI, sample instances
For single-variable statistic, can just sample values
Sampling a variable & taking variable from sample are the same
Two or more variables – must sample instances to keep them together
Bootstrapping P-values
Sampling Review
Wrapping Up
A cleaned and ready-to-model data set consists of instances.

Most of our sampling procedures should sample instances.
