Example Chart
Parts to identify:
X-axis
Y-axis
Axis labels
Data
From “Enhancing Classroom Instruction with Online News”, by Michael D. Ekstrand, Katherine Landau Wright, and Maria Soledad Pera (Aslib Journal of Information Mangement, online June 2020)
What Charts Can Reveal
Patterns (or lack thereof)
Comparisons
Compare two bars
See where points are
Trends
Do lines go up or down? Or jaggedy?
Documenting Charts
Clearly state:
What is being presented (what is each point?)
What values are plotted on the axes
Often, this is done in the axis label
Make sure units are clear if relevant
Sometimes this can be implicit, but if in any doubt: be explicit

The chart + caption should be interpretable on their own!
Observations may be saved for referencing text.
Captions, Titles, and Context
In a paper, a figure has a caption
Labels the figure
Can provide interpretive guidance
Other contexts, we often need a title
Shorter, doesn’t explain details
Labels the whole figure
In notebooks, surrounding text may be sufficient, but title often a good idea for quick reading.
Pitfalls
Distorting perspective or distances – make sure lengths accurately represent quantities
Bar charts start at 0!
Violating conventions
Users have expectations, e.g. linear, even spacing
Don’t Rely on Graphics
Graphics illustrate an effect

They may help find an effect

They are not conclusive proof of an effect
Wrapping Up
Graphics can make data clearer, leverage human perception to understand it.

Graphics are not a replacement for numeric analysis, but give it context.

Clearly label and describe graphics.
