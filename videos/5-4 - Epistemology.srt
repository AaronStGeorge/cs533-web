00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:13,300
Hello again, this video. I want to talk to you about ways of knowing what's called epistemology in our learning outcomes for this video,

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:21,370
for us to understand different sources of knowledge and identify saw sources of knowledge that are appropriate to a question,

3
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,620
because the way that we're going about work in this class, we said at the very beginning,

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:37,180
data science is the practice of using data to gain quantitative insight in the questions of social, scientific or business interest.

5
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,800
It is not the only way to obtain knowledge is not the only source of knowledge.

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:49,870
And so I want us in this video to think a little bit about some of these other sources of knowledge and how they relate to each other.

7
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:57,690
So some types of knowledge we can can encounter are quantitative knowledge that we've been working on in this class.

8
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,780
I'm going to work on for the rest of the class. And that's around numbers and quantities, qualitative knowledge,

9
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,510
which looks at the actual content and we aren't doing quantitative count like we aren't counting things.

10
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:21,520
We are computing statistics. We're looking at say what taxed or what videos or what images actually say analytical or knowledge or proofs.

11
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,400
These are these are mathematical derivations.

12
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,740
There's no there's no data in them that's driving them.

13
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,550
For example, the fact that the T statistic is distributed under the T distribution, under the null hypothesis.

14
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,830
That's mathematically proven. We didn't do a bunch of simulations or experiments to figure that out.

15
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,500
There's theory building to put together knowledge from a variety of sources and from a variety

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:58,360
of experiments or studies or investigations into a coherent theory of how a subject works.

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:06,820
And then there's critical knowledge that pokes at and investigates the structure, particularly the power structures.

18
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,600
But the structure of how something how a process for producing knowledge or how a thing we're studying is put

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:22,510
together and what how it got to where it is and what impact that may have on the results that we get from it.

20
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,990
One thing that's important to note is both quantitative and qualitative forms of knowledge are empirical.

21
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:34,090
They're getting from the data to the conclusions or to the insights that we have on

22
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:42,700
the question of quantitative methods do not have a monopoly on being data driven.

23
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,860
No one form of knowledge is the best.

24
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:53,560
And we often need multiple forms of knowledge together to gain a full understanding of something that we're trying to study.

25
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,520
So a quantitative measure methods are the things that we've been doing this semester, numeric methods and estimates.

26
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,290
We could ask how many of us there are, if something, what fraction and have some property.

27
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,020
We can try to predict numeric outcomes, lots of different things we can do with numbers.

28
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,790
And there's various sub methods. For example, observational studies.

29
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,540
They look at what we can see. We have data that we've collected.

30
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,370
Either we've gone and collected it in the field.

31
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:29,530
We have it from a dataset and we can see we've observed some process and we can look for correlations,

32
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,450
we can look for connections, and we can try to gain insight based on what we can observe in the world.

33
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,780
Experimental studies look at what happens when we intervene, when we act, when we change something.

34
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:54,090
How does what we're studying respond to it? So the observational studies can be so we look at our penguins and we can see their flipper lengths.

35
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,620
We can see their body masses. Experimental studies can let us get at.

36
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,520
Well, what happens when we give some penguins one diet and then other penguins another diet to understand it,

37
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,300
to isolate the impact of diet on, say, penguin growth?

38
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,690
And a simulation study looks at what happens in synthetic environments,

39
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:23,640
and these allow us to run a lot more analysis and studies than we can in an experiment because we don't have to collect data.

40
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:31,770
We don't have to use experimental resources in order to to create and observe changes.

41
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,650
We can just turn read a bunch of random numbers.

42
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:45,480
According to some structured process, and these are really good for understanding, particularly what have our made her methods.

43
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:53,640
So. If we have a method for studying what would happen in an experiment, we can simulate a bunch of different experiments,

44
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:00,930
maybe with different outcomes to see what our method would do when we got to control the experimental results because we made them up.

45
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,850
This is a really powerful tool for studying the statistical properties themselves.

46
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,750
And one of the things, especially those of you who are in the data science P.

47
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,550
D program, but also as you get deeper in your data science knowledge,

48
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,040
that's something that's going to be be very important for you to be able to go to to level up

49
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,890
from using the methods that we were developing and that we're learning to study phenomenon.

50
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:34,410
We're going to use we're gonna use our linear models to study something about penguins, maybe to being able to study the methods themselves.

51
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:44,280
Can what can we say about how a linear model works or about how a T test works or or the bootstrap simulation studies are really useful for that.

52
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,420
But these quantitative methods, they can ask some really useful.

53
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,400
They can address some really useful questions. We can see how often something happens.

54
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,840
We can see when it happens. How likely is it when X happens?

55
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,870
How likely is it for Y to happen? We can get these kinds of how often, how many, how likely kinds of questions.

56
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,450
What's hard to answer is why does X happen or when X happens?

57
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,110
What do those situations actually look like?

58
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,920
So an example, I'm going to talk a little bit more about it as we go through the slide, but we're trying to understand.

59
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,540
So we've got we've got a large company with a number of locations, B, where a supermarket chain.

60
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:34,680
And we want to understand employee retention. We can look at, say, how often employees leave or say, leave within their first year.

61
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:42,300
We can ask. When some particular change happened to the store, change happens in personnel policies.

62
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,290
How likely are employees to leave or if one employee leaves?

63
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:54,300
Are there more that are likely to follow? But, well, we don't really what the numbers can't give us is for any given employee leaving.

64
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:03,540
What was the situation? Why did they leave? It also doesn't give us insight into what new phenomenon should we look for.

65
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,610
The numbers can't tell us on their own and the quantitative methods can't tell us on their own.

66
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,190
What questions to even ask of the data. So this gets us to qualitative methods.

67
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,900
And qualitative methods are about interpretation and analysis.

68
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:25,200
And it lets us look at questions like why did someone do X quantitative?

69
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,550
Lets us ask how often it happened. Qualitative. Let's start to get at.

70
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,630
Why did they do it? Why did it happen? Or what do people want?

71
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:40,170
And the key thing about qualitative methods is that they engage directly with some kind of source material,

72
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,670
written text images, interviews and interview transcripts.

73
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,580
But you've got some source material, often textual.

74
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,290
But sometimes it's visual, sometimes it's video, and you're engaging directly with it and interpreting it.

75
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,090
Humans ever. You can't import pandas that qualitative, that's not a thing.

76
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:07,190
There's a very human process of engaging with the material in order to derive knowledge.

77
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,110
One quick note is that surveys where they get data from humans are not on their own qualitative.

78
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,780
If you ask someone a Likert Stiles survey strongly disagree to strongly agree and a bunch of questions.

79
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,720
You're getting quantitative data. If you have open free form text and you start to go analyze what they said.

80
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,400
That's qualitative data.

81
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:35,370
So in our example problem, if we want to understand employee concerns and opportunities to improve how our organization is treating employees,

82
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,260
we could go do some structured interviews and a semi structured interview.

83
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,560
Is it interview where you have a plan going into it, but it's not a rigorous answer.

84
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,030
These questions in a row and we're done kind of plan. You have goals for the interview.

85
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,550
You have key questions thought of in advance.

86
00:08:53,550 --> 00:09:00,870
But the conversation, an interview can also go in the directions that seem natural as the interviewer is leading through it.

87
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,100
And the resulting data is you've got all of these interviews with employees. You.

88
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,280
You're probably going to transcribe them because we're doing the analysis as often a

89
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,190
lot easier to work with the transcribed text rather than the actual than the audio.

90
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,740
But you don't. It's expensive. And if you're going to sit down and have a half hour interview with each employee, that takes a long time.

91
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,050
You don't have time to interview them all.

92
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:27,450
One key thing, when we're doing quantitative methods or goals, statistical representations that the statistics we computer,

93
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:34,440
accurate estimates of the underlying parameters, the goal and qualitative analysis is not statistical representation.

94
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,740
The goal is to make sure that the different.

95
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:48,310
Subgroups and sex and characteristics and dynamics that you might try to be look, be able to find in the data are all represented at least once.

96
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,280
We're not going to be getting statistical counts out of this.

97
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,640
And so the statistical representation is just not the right way to frame thinking about qualitative responses.

98
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,720
So one particular method, there's many methods for qualitative analysis.

99
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:09,580
You can spend. I have spent my research career of 10 plus years now getting very good at a lot of quantitative methods.

100
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,430
You can spend that much time and then the entire rest of your career getting very good at qualitative methods.

101
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:22,120
There is skill just as much as the quantitative methods. There are no easier really to do them well.

102
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,040
But one particular qualitative method is called grounded theory,

103
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:34,180
and the idea of grounded theory is to start from the text itself and build up to ideas and figure out what themes are in the text

104
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:43,970
and how they connect to each other in a way that is as close to the text as possible and is derived from the text as possible.

105
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:51,670
And to get the ideas and the concepts from the text rather than from your preconceived ideas going into it of what should be in the text.

106
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,710
So what you do when you're doing grounded theory, if you're going to do grounded theory on these interviews,

107
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:03,770
is that you would break them into distinct statements or observations and then you would group these observations together into themes.

108
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,220
So you would take an observation. And if it's like an existing theme that you have, you would add it.

109
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,610
And if it's not like any any of the existing themes, you would start a new theme taking observations.

110
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,180
See, is this like any of the five kinds of things I've seen so far? Yes.

111
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,250
Put it in the pile. Like actually physically moving things around the piles is useful for this.

112
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:27,850
And if not, we're going to start a new one. So you have this this matching thing going on.

113
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,480
And then as you're going through the process, or once you get to the end of the process, you may merge.

114
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,290
Themes may say, oh, these things were really they were seeming separate.

115
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:40,270
I am coding, but they really do seem like they're together or maybe they're subthemes of another theme.

116
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:48,910
Now, in statistics, we have this notion of, OK, we have a statistically significant sample or a statistically significant results.

117
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,770
We know if we found it, we can talk about our sample size and things with this kind of a method.

118
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:02,320
What you use as your stopping condition is what's called saturation. And here, like stopping early to get statistical significance, not valid.

119
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:12,040
Saturation is. And the idea of saturation is that more data does not reveal more concepts.

120
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:23,020
So you've grouped your things together. You found 12 themes and doing this grounded theory process with another trend.

121
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,550
Another few interviews does not generate any new themes.

122
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:35,390
And this, if you're doing the process, if you got confidence in the process, then what this means is that you've hit conceptual saturation.

123
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,610
You have identified the themes that are coming from your data. More data isn't adding new themes.

124
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,330
So we have the themes. Our goal here is to extract themes. Now we have them.

125
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,860
The outcome of this process is our themes with illustrative quotations.

126
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,470
So we've put these observations in cities into the additional into the different themes and these observations themselves,

127
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,140
the things that our our interviewees, our employees said.

128
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,520
Those are quotations that illustrate the dynamic going on in that theme.

129
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,910
As I said before, qualitative methods are empirical. The conclusions are grounded in and supported by data.

130
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:19,610
The data is just analyzed differently. To get to those conclusions. Qualitative is very useful for demonstrating the existence of a phenomenon.

131
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:26,770
People do this because people say they they give or there's this reason why people leave.

132
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,760
Yes, we have at least one who said that was the reason they leaved in our in our data set.

133
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,790
And they can also help us elucidate the mechanisms for phenomenon because they allow us to dove much more deeply into each

134
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:48,410
specific example to understand what were the factors that caused this employee to leave or that causes them to continue to stay.

135
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,150
And the data is is what's called sometimes thick but low in quantity.

136
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,080
We don't have very many of these interviews. Relatively speaking, we might have 10 or 20.

137
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:05,600
We might even have 50. But we're not going to have the hundreds of data points we might have from a survey or from some other quantitative method.

138
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,430
But each of those individual data points,

139
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:15,440
an interview with a with an employee is much richer and gives us much more detail on it, on individual samples.

140
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,280
You can also mix methods, what's called mixed methods, research.

141
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,100
There's a variety of ways that you can combine quantitative and qualitative methods together.

142
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,190
I'm going to talk briefly about two.

143
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:38,940
One is where you do a qualitative study first so you can do a qualitative study with a small group to identify what concerns people have.

144
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,390
You may do some interviews with employees to understand some of their concerns around workplace safety or workplace environment.

145
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:51,480
And then you can follow that up with a quantitative study to see how widely held these different

146
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,760
concerns that came up in your qualitative study or qualitative demonstrates existence.

147
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,590
Quantitative measures, prevalence. Another one you can do as quantitative first.

148
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,280
You could do a quantitative analysis to identify the stores with low employee retention.

149
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,370
That's something quantitative analysis can do well. And then a qualitative analysis can help you understand why.

150
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,420
So go to some of those stores, interview some of the employees,

151
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:24,530
interview some of the managers and understand what's happening at the stores that have low employee retention.

152
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:32,690
These are just two ways that we can use qualitative methods and quantitative methods together, either to have the qualitative methods,

153
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:40,490
generate the hypotheses that we're going to go test quantitatively and measure the prevalence of quantitatively

154
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:51,200
or to better understand the dynamics and the nuances of what's happening in an effect that we see quantitatively.

155
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,860
So 30. What is 30 mean?

156
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,840
Numbers on their own don't mean anything. We have to have context to interpret this meaning.

157
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,560
Thirty is the typical size of this class. This fall, we only have twenty three.

158
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,580
But the typical size, this class is 30. OK, that give me a little more meaning.

159
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,580
At least know what we're talking about now in our department.

160
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,830
That's large for an art, for a graduate class, but it's about average for the department's classes overall.

161
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,600
OK. That helps. Gives me context to understand that we're looking at a large graduate class.

162
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,840
Why do we care about graduate classes as well? Class size affects teacher student engagement.

163
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,740
So this gives us. There's many other reasons why we might care about class size.

164
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,360
But it's easier to individually engage with students when the class size is relatively small.

165
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,830
That gives us more context for understanding why we even care about this value.

166
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:47,140
So we need context to interpret quantities and identify quantities of interest.

167
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:53,140
Qualitative methods can give us a lot of that context and a really, really rich way.

168
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,660
Now I want to talk briefly about analytical methods. Analytical methods are dealing with mathematical proofs and derivations.

169
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,270
As I said, they're usually quantitative, but they're not empirical. We're not looking at what data is telling us.

170
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:12,570
We're looking at the intrinsic fundamental properties of computation of method, etc. They're always true, given their assumptions that they.

171
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:19,840
If we have a proof that given some assumptions X follows, that's not something that depends on the condition.

172
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,480
When the assumptions hold, assuming that the proof is correct, it holds it may be probabilistic.

173
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,270
The proof we have may be something about how often something happens, like confidence intervals.

174
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,070
Confidence intervals don't always contain the mean. But we have a probability.

175
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:42,780
We have a proof about how often they do contain the mean.

176
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:52,890
Then another method is I want to bring up to you a little bit is critical methods, including what's called critical theory.

177
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,980
And the key idea of these methods is to analyze and explicate the power structures that

178
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,420
are at play and the thing that we're studying or in our process of studying in itself.

179
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:10,350
Who has power in a given situation? What are the effects of that power and that distribution of power?

180
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:17,880
Can also ask, how does perspective and the power or lack thereof that comes with it affect the questions and the can we equip.

181
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,640
The questions we ask and the conclusions that we come to from those?

182
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:33,030
For example, if we're trying to understand employee retention, the fact that it's employer or the employer's agent talking to the employee,

183
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:38,790
that creates a power dynamic that can affect the employees response to the survey if they think

184
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,140
things they say might be might affect their employment or the terms of their employment,

185
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:50,100
that might affect what they say. But that power dynamic can, in a very direct way, affect the data.

186
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:58,860
The results that we get out of it. So one way that one application for thinking about power is to look at who is making the decisions.

187
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,570
This looks at the overall process itself.

188
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:07,290
What we're doing this study to understand employee retention and what is causing low employee retention or what's caused it,

189
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:14,190
what's what's making our employees want to stay with the organization. But.

190
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:20,280
Credit one thing. Critical methods are going to get at is. Who is making the study about the decisions about the study?

191
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,570
Who's deciding what questions to ask in our survey or or our interviews?

192
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:31,370
Who is deciding who to talk to in this? And who's going to be deciding what to do with the results?

193
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:38,370
Because. If it is a collection of employees that are deciding what to do with the results,

194
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,230
that's very different than efforts, organization management that's deciding what to do with the results.

195
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:50,160
One thing also that's important to note is asking employees and questions about retention,

196
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,540
even very, very good, even if it's done very, very good faith.

197
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:03,640
We want to make the organization a good place to work. For going to ask our employees what.

198
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,130
What they see going on. How they think about their their work.

199
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,110
Asking the poor ye employees on its own is not sharing power in the way that critical methods.

200
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:18,700
Think about who has power and how it's distributed.

201
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:25,140
So then I want to talk then a little bit about theory, not in the critical theory sense, but in the theory building sense,

202
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:35,110
some dictionary defines theory as a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena.

203
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:43,790
It's a it's a kahir is a framework. That links together our findings from a lot of different studies, from a lot of different experiments,

204
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:56,600
from different sources of knowledge into a coherent explanation or way of thinking about a phenomenon or a set of problems and theory drives analysis.

205
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,590
Because if we're doing good data science, if we're doing good quantitative analysis, our questions aren't just made up.

206
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:09,590
They come from a reason we have from theory why that's a relevant question to ask.

207
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:15,820
And theory in turn, comes from all of these sources because data.

208
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:23,320
And analytical and query and critical inquiry, they refine their confirm and confirm and sometimes they reject theories.

209
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,260
The process by which that happens is long and complicated and is the the subject of study

210
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,750
of both the philosophy of science and the discipline called science and technology studies.

211
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:41,970
But. Feary and our defriended are different modes of inquiry, have this.

212
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:48,780
This interactive relationship. That we have a theory that tells us things to go look for, we go look for them.

213
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:55,560
Those in turn come back and help us refine our general understanding of how the thing we're studying works.

214
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,410
Lastly, I want to say a little bit about our science and technology studies concept.

215
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:08,640
So often said that knowledge is socially constructed and it becomes relevant, particularly when we start thinking about as relevant in general,

216
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,510
being to try to understand how our tools work and their limitations and their possibilities.

217
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,900
It also becomes very important to start to think about the social ramifications

218
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,910
of data science and the ramifications of social structures on data science.

219
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:32,350
But what this means is that knowledge comes through processes and those processes are social.

220
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:40,060
Social construction does not mean that knowledge is fake or made up or unreliable or like, oh, it's socially constructed so we can dismiss it.

221
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:48,130
No, that's not what it means. All it means is that what we know about the world we know is through social processes.

222
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:53,920
Because you're in this class learning how to do data analysis.

223
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:02,350
I am teaching you a particular way of approaching data, a particular way of applying statistical tests and interpreting the results.

224
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,610
That is a social process. We're having these dialogs and conversations about it.

225
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:13,200
I learned these through a social process. I subject when we go and we publish papers.

226
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,500
We subject them to a peer review process. This is a social process, our peers look at it and assess it.

227
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:33,420
And as a as a community. We come to our notion, sometimes agreed upon, sometimes contested, about what kinds of questions we should ask,

228
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,510
how we should go about answering them, how do we know if what we've found is true?

229
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:48,240
Well, with our tools for doing that may be very reliable in the sense that they produce knowledge that's useful for for predicting future behavior,

230
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,460
for understanding what's going on around us.

231
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,680
There's still there's social processes and they were developed socially and

232
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:04,410
they therefore have the various biases and limitations of a social process.

233
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:12,140
And understanding that I find helps me.

234
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,660
Respect science and statistics and the quantitative methods we're studying.

235
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:27,780
More. Because rather than putting them on a pedestal that they can never achieve of, they are the ultimate, for example.

236
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,350
They are the ultimate source of knowledge. Some who basically go there were like,

237
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:36,990
if we can't show it with a randomized controlled trial and a statistic and a statistical test, not going to believe it.

238
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:44,430
And it puts them in what they can actually do. They can generate a lot of quantitative insight that can help us understand the world better.

239
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:48,510
We have processes that we think are probably pretty good.

240
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:59,550
Understanding the social nature of these processes is a useful tool for us to be able to think about how to make them better.

241
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:11,170
And so it's it's it's important to recognize this the social nature of our methods, but not to let that paralyze us.

242
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,690
And they said not to let that dismiss them. It doesn't mean we're not finding useful knowledge.

243
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,190
It just means there's social processes that got us to where we are today.

244
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:25,230
So to wrap up quantitative measurements and analysis are not the only or the best way to produce knowledge.

245
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:44,033
There is no best way to produce knowledge. Multiple sources of knowledge together give multiple sources of knowledge together.
