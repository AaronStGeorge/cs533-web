The Q-Q Plot
Points: quantiles
Y-axis: quantile in data
X-axis: quantile from distribution

Straight line indicates match

X can be:
Values from a theoretical
2nd data set
Plotting
Statsmodels: qqplot
line=45 shows ‘match’ line
fit=True aligns data to work w/ line
Notebook demonstrates
Also shows how to build your own
Don’t do that

Wrapping Up
Q-Q plots let us compare data against a distribution (or other data)

Data is on a straight line when the distribution matches.
