Chart Types
XKCD #688, ⓒ Randall Monroe. Used under CC-BY-NC
Bar Charts
Show numeric values grouped by a categorical (or ordinal) variable
Best with moderate number of categories
Can have second categorical in bar color
Y often mean, sum, or count within group
Can rotate to horizontal bar
Whiskers: confidence interval

Bar Charts
Functions:
sns.countplot(count by category)
sns.catplot(mean by category)
plt.bar
pn.geom_bar

Bar Chart Rules
Never start y axis at anything but 0 – skews relative sizes
If including whiskers: define how they are computed
If using SNS catplot or countplot without a color group: set color, or they’ll recolor for no reason.
Histograms
Bar chart where ‘categorical’ is bins of a numeric value.
Bar chart showing relative frequency of categorical values also a histogram

Y is either number or fraction of occurrences

Goal is to see relative frequency of different values

One way to graphically describe a distribution.
Scatter Plots
Shows two numeric values
Observations have two numeric variables
Want to see how they relate
Does one increase with the other?
Do points clump in space?
Are there other patterns? Outliers?
Restaurant Tips and Bills
From Seaborn documentation
Refinements
Color by categorical variable
Plot a trend or context line (not shown)
X can be categorical (point plot or strip plot)

Functions:
plt.scatter
sns.scatterplot
pn.geom_point
Restaurant Tips and Bills
From Seaborn documentation
Line Plots
Two numeric values
One y per x value
Emphasizes progression (or continuity) from one to the next
Very common for time series

Functions
sns.lineplot
plt.line
pn.geom_line
From Seaborn tutorial
Box Plots
Show distribution of numeric variable grouped by categorical
Median
Quartiles
Min/max
Outliers (in much software)

Functions:
sns.boxplot
plt.boxplot
pn.geom_box
From Seaborn gallery
More Plot Types
Violin plots (like box, but mean-based)
Swarm plots (categorical scatter plot)
Pie (usually best avoid – bar or stacked bar)
Donut
Rug (displaying distribution in a margin)

Wrapping Up
Many types of charts.

Learning good graphics techniques takes time and practice.
