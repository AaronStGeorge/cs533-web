## {{mvideo}} Simulation

This video talks more about simulation as a method for studying statistical techniques, which you are doing in the assignment.
I also describe more of NumPy's random number generation facilities.

:::{tip}
You should set random seeds for all work that will need randomness, including train/test splits for evaluating predictors.

## {{mvideo}} Variance, RÂ², and the Sum of Squares

This video provides more detail on *explained variance* and what the $R^2$ means.

## {{mvideo}} Overfitting

This video introduces the idea of *overfitting*: learning too much from the training data so we can't predict the testing data.

## {{mnotebook}} Loss-Based Regression Notebook

Read the [minimization regression notebook](./BadRegression.ipynb) notebook.

## {{mquiz}} Week 9 Quiz

Take the Week 9 quiz in Blackboard (will be up by end of Saturday).

## {{mtask}} Practice

There are several ways you can practice the material so far:

- Practice more regressions with World Bank data
- Measure World Bank data predictive accuracy with train-test evaluation and mean squared error

## {{massignment}} Assignment 4

Assignment 4 is due **October 25, 2020**.
