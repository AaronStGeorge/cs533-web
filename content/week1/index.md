# Week 1 — Question

:::{draft}
This content is still in draft state and has not yet been finalized.
Do not depend on it as the final requirements for this week.
:::

The key learning outcomes for this week are:

- Ask and refine questions that can be answered with data
- Install and run the software required for the course
- Write and run basic Python code in a Jupyter notebook
- Begin to think about the complexity of meaningful questions

This week uses chapters 1–3 from the textbook.  If you already know Python, that should mostly be review.

This week's videos are available as a [Panopto playlist](https://boisestate.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?pid=fe0a0a3c-4b1a-40cc-93ae-ac1c0130d704).

## Introduction

This video introduces the course and our learning outcomes for the term.

This video will be re-recorded before class.

## Asking Questions

In this video, I introduce *questions* in their broader context of using data to advance goals. 
I also introduce the idea of **operationalization**, which will be a key concept throughout the class.

## :material-video: Questioning Questions {: #questioning data-length="8m54s"}

We make our operationalizations better by questioning them.  What do they capture?  Who or what do they prioritize?

## :material-clipboard-list: Week 1 Quiz {: #quiz}

Take the Week 1 Quiz in Blackboard (it's under “Quizzes”).

!!! note "Tuesday Breakpoint"

    If you have completed through this point, you are ready for Tuesday's synchronous activities.

!!! note "First Week Grace"

    The due date for the Week 1 quiz is flexible.  I strongly encourage you to complete it on Monday,
    but it is not due until the end of the week.

    Subsequent weekly quizzes will be due at the end of the day on Monday.

!!! tip "Working Ahead"

    While this and following sections are not required before Tuesday's class, there is no reason you can't
    get started whenever you want.

In this video, I talk about about my background, teaching, and research, as well as the structure of publishing computer science research and my professional involvement with different parts of that.

On Piazza, there is a thread for self-introductions.  Reply and introduce yourself!

**This counts towards participation points.**

## :material-book: Textbook Chapters {: #textbook}

The Python material we are working on this week is a subset of the material in chapters **1–3** of the [textbook](../../resources/index.md#books).
I don't expect to you get through all 3 chapters thoroughly this week, and we will be introducing more Python features as we need them throughout
the semester.
I will note specific chapters and sections relevant to videos in their _Resources_ subsections.

## :material-check-circle: Install Software {: #install}

Make sure you have [installed the course software](../../resources/software.md) so you can complete the assignment.
