# Week 1 — Questions

:::{module} week1
:::

:::{draft}
This content is still in draft state and has not yet been finalized.
Do not depend on it as the final requirements for this week.
I may also be re-recording some of the videos.
:::

The key learning outcomes for this week are:

- Ask and refine questions that can be answered with data
- Install and run the software required for the course
- Write and run basic Python code in a Jupyter notebook
- Begin to think about the complexity of meaningful questions

This week uses chapters 1–3 from the textbook.  If you already know Python, that should mostly be review.

This week's videos are available as a [Panopto playlist](https://boisestate.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?pid=fe0a0a3c-4b1a-40cc-93ae-ac1c0130d704).

## {{mcal}} Week Deadlines

## {{mvideo}} Asking Questions

In this video, I introduce *questions* in their broader context of using data to advance goals. 
I also introduce the idea of **operationalization**, which will be a key concept throughout the class.

## {{mvideo}} Questioning Questions

We make our {term}`operationalizations <Operationalization>` better by questioning them.  What do they capture?  Who or what do they prioritize?

## {{mclass}} Tuesday Class

On Tuesday, we will:

- Introduce the class
- Start working on defining and clarifying questions
- Set expectations for the week and semester

## {{mtask}} Pre-Class Inventory

Fill out the pre-class skill inventory and team matching by **11:59 pm on Tuesday**. 

## {{mvideo}} About Me

In this video, I talk about about my background, teaching, and research, as well as the structure of publishing computer science research and my professional involvement with different parts of that.

## {{mquiz}} Week 1 Quiz

The Week 1 individual quiz (in Canvas) is due at **8am Thursday**.
It is only over material prior to this point.

:::{tip}
I recommend watching the remaining videos before class Thursday as well, but they will not
be tested over in the quiz.

## {{mvideo}} {{mnotebook}} Our First Python Notebook

This video shows you how to start Jupyter, create a notebook, and run Python code.
It also shows you how to prepare a notebook to submit as an assignment.

## {{mclass}} Thursday class

In class on Thursday, we will:

- Meet our teams
- Take the Week 1 team quiz (over the same material as the individual quiz)
- Debug software installations
- Activity to dive deeper into defining problems and questions

## {{mbook}} Textbook Chapters

The Python material we are working on this week is a subset of the material in chapters **1–3** of the [textbook](../../resources/index.md#books).
I don't expect to you get through all 3 chapters thoroughly this week, and we will be introducing more Python features as we need them throughout
the semester.
I will note specific chapters and sections relevant to videos in their _Resources_ subsections.

## {{mvideo}} Data Types and Control Flow
