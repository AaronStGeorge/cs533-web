# ðŸš§ Week 6 â€” Two Variables (Sep. 27â€“Oct. 1) ðŸš§

:::{draft}
This content is still in draft state and has not yet been finalized.
:::

:::{alert}
The first midterm exam will be from 5PM Wednesday through 5PM Saturday.
:::

This week's learning outcomes are:

1.  Display two potentially-related numeric variables for exploratory analysis.
2.  Compute correlation coefficients between variables
3.  Run a linear regression

Since we have the exam this week, the lecture load is significantly reduced.

!!! note "Error in Video"

    In this video, I list the Pandas correlation function as `cor`. The correct name is `corr`.
