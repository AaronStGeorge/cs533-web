{% import 'video.md' as media %}

!!! warning "Draft content"

    This content is still in draft state and has not yet been finalized.
    Do not depend on it as the final requirements for this week.

!!! attention "Midterm A"

    The first midterm exam will be from 5PM Wednesday through 5PM Saturday.

This week's learning outcomes are:

1.  Display two potentially-related numeric variables for exploratory analysis.
2.  Compute correlation coefficients between variables
3.  Run a linear regression

[TOC]

This week's videos are also available as a [Panopto playlist](https://boisestate.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?pid=cabf2b0d-5b7c-493e-adb5-ac4100523399).

!!! info "Midterm Assessment Protocol"

    This week, the Center for Teaching and Learning is conducting a midterm course assessment for this course, to give me feedback on how it is going and how to improve.
    This survey will be open for one week. The link is in Piazza.
