# ðŸš§ Week 6 â€” Two Variables (Sep. 27â€“Oct. 1) ðŸš§

:::{draft}
This content is still in draft state and has not yet been finalized.

The midterm instructions, however **are** final.
:::

:::{alert}
The first midterm exam will be from 5PM Wednesday through 5PM Saturday.
:::

This week's learning outcomes are:

1.  Display two potentially-related numeric variables for exploratory analysis.
2.  Compute correlation coefficients between variables
3.  Run a linear regression

Since we have the exam this week, the lecture load is significantly reduced.

## {{mcal}} Deadlines

- Midterm A **Tuesday 9:00â€“10:15 AM** (in class)
- Quiz 6 **Thursday by 8AM**

## {{mquiz}} Midterm A

The first midterm is on Tuesday.  It is written to take about an hour, and covers material
up through and including Week 5.

### Format

The exam is a written in-person exam.  It will contain a variety of questions to assess your ability
to understand and apply concepts from the class.  Question formats include:

- Multiple-choice
- True/false
- Matching
- Fill-in-the-blank
- Short answer

I may ask you to do a range of things on the exam, including (but not limited to):

- Define a concept
- Compute a metric from a small quantity of data
- Interpret a chart

### Exam Rules

- You may have **1 note sheet**, letter- or A4-sized, single-sided.  (For the final, you will be allowed a two-sided note sheet.)
- You should not need a calculator, but may bring one if you wish.
- You may answer in either pen or pencil.

### Study Tips

- Review the previous quizzes and assignments.
- Review lecture slides to see where you are unclear on concepts and need to review.
- Skim assigned readings, particularly the section headings to remind yourself what was in them.
